            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:177530:6"/>perceiue <hi>Clinias, Axio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> his ſonne, together with <hi>Damon</hi> the Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and <hi>Charmides</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Glaucon,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards the faire fountaine: I preſently left my owne way, to go meete them, to the end we might more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently diſcourſe &amp; talk together.

<pb facs="tcp:177530:6"/>For, my Father is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly fallen ſo grieuouſly ſicke, that wee looke ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his death than life; for which cauſe he ſeemes to bee wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perplexed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though when he was in perfect health, he laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at them, that feared death (as though it had bin ſome hideous Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblin, or griſly Antick) taunting, and ſcornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mocking them for the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I pray you therefore, come and ſee him, that he may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by your good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:7"/>as you know very well how to doe it, that hee may patiently and acceptably attend his death. And for my part, this will bee one of the laſt dutifull offices, which I ſhall performe towards my Father. For me, <hi>Clinias,</hi> then I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, you ſhall euer finde mee ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour my ſelfe for you in any thing within my power; but eſpecially in a reſpect, ſo deuout and religious. Wherfore let vs goe quickly; for if it be ſo, we muſt not delay
<pb facs="tcp:177530:7"/>time. <hi>Clin.</hi> I am ſure that your very preſence will much comfort my Father, if he be yet aliue; for, by ſuch good means he hath ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-times eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, of dangerous mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. <hi>Socr.</hi> Well, wee found <hi>Axiocus</hi> in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable good ſtate of bodie; but in his minde ſo afflicted, that he ſtood in great neede of ſome conſolation: for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer left turning, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the one, and then on the other ſide, ſighing and lamenting with a great agitation
<pb facs="tcp:177530:8"/>&amp; motion of his armes. Seeing him in this ſtate, I began thus to breake with him. Why, <hi>Axio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> what meanes this? what's become of your dayly brags, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of Vertue? where is now your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible courage? when you haue ſhewed your ſelfe ſo valiant through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole combat, &amp; now drawing neer to the end, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſhould receiue the reward, and recompence of your trauailes, ſilly Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe you now faint?
<pb facs="tcp:177530:8"/>why doe you not better obſerue the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all mankind, you being a man well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced by your yeares, and an Athenian? Doe you no more remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what all men haue often in their mouthes, that this our life is but a Pilgrimage? and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hauing honeſtly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer our dayes, we muſt then chearfully and merily remoue out of this preſent life? But to be thus deiected, and to leaue this world, with as much grief, as a little
<pb facs="tcp:177530:9"/>childe would doe; this ill beſeemes that wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and prudence, which is expected to be in men of your yeeres. <hi>Axio.</hi> It is true, <hi>Socrates,</hi> and you do aduertiſe me for my good: but I knowe in what maner; for when it comes to the point, and to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended indeed, all this brauery of wordes cloſely ſlinkes away, without ſo much as a cogitation theron: and in ſtead therof, a certain feare takes place, which ſurpriſeth my minde,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:9"/>when I think that I muſt bee depriued of this light, of ſo much world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods, to lie and rot, I knowe not where, in a place where I ſhall not not be ſeen, or heard, of any body, there to bee changed into wormes and loathſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Soc.</hi> This falles out vnto thee <hi>Axiocus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, you couple ſenſe, and the ſtate of death together; ſo that your wordes and deedes are
<pb facs="tcp:177530:10"/>one repugnant to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For you conſider not, that at one inſtant, you grieue for the loſſe of ſenſe, and the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which you fear to feele, together with the preuention of the delights of this life: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as if after death, you were to leade another earthly life, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the ſenſes which now you doe; whereas your body ſhall bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued as it was before your conception. And, as you felt no kind of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, in that time, when
<pb facs="tcp:177530:10"/>
               <hi>Draco</hi> and <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> gouerned the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth (for, then you were not exiſtent, to feele either good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil) ſo after death your body ſhal be ſenſible of nothing, it being then free from the touch of any diſcommodities. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way therefore with all theſe apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and be aſſured, that after our diſſolution, and that the ſoule is returned to her proper place, the body which remains behind is not that which we cal man, but rather a lump
<pb facs="tcp:177530:11"/>of earth and clay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon or ſenſe. And to ſay the trueth, we are and ſhould rightly bee tearmed ſoule; which is an immortall creature, incloſed in a corrupt body, as within a ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king priſon. As for this fleſhly tabernacle, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath enuironed vs therewith, for our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement; the pleaſures thereof being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ready ſwiftly to flie away, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: whereas, on the contrary, the vexations
<pb facs="tcp:177530:11"/>are vehement, and of long continuance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of all kinde of conſolation. What ſhould I ſpeake of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of the heat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our ſenſes, and of the vices which lurke, and are couched in the ſame? The ſoule being diffuſed, &amp; ſpread through al the conduits of the body, is vrged to cry out, &amp; ſigh after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which ſhe ſo truely reſembles, deſiring this life and releaſment, as affectionately, as the thirſty doe pant and
<pb facs="tcp:177530:12"/>breathe after the coole and freſh waters: and ſo the departure from this our life, is a change fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euill to good. <hi>Axi.</hi> But, <hi>Socrates,</hi> if you tearme this life ſo euil, why doe you tarie in it; ſeeing you are of farre greater vnderſtanding, than we ſimple people are? <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. Axiocus,</hi> you ſpeak not of me as you ſhould doe; but, after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Athens,</hi> you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that I am a very wiſe man, becauſe I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and argue of one thing and another; for
<pb facs="tcp:177530:12"/>my part, I deſire to knowe euen that which is common; ſo farre off am I, from thinking my ſelfe able to reſolue of ſo important matters as theſe, whereof wee now intreat. In effect, whatſoeuer before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, was taken out of the diſcourſes of wiſe <hi>Prodicus,</hi> whome you knowe wel, &amp; to whom I haue giuen money twice or thrice: For he neuer reades a Lecture to any for nothing; for in his mouth hee hath ordinarily that ſaying of
<pb facs="tcp:177530:13"/>
               <hi>Epicharmus,</hi> One hand muſt waſh another; we muſt giue one thing to receiue another. Laſtly, when we were at <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> his lodging, he that is the ſonne of <hi>Hippocin,</hi> this <hi>Prodicus</hi> minding to vtter his whole ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, produced ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons, againſt the loue of this life, as I was ready to haue haſtened my owne death: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, my ſoule did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but deſire death. <hi>Axi.</hi> What ſaid he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? <hi>Soc.</hi> I will rehearſe it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, ſo farre as I can
<pb facs="tcp:177530:13"/>remember. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vſed this ſpeach: Is any part of our age without vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? doth not the Infant weepe at his comming out of his mothers wombe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning his dayes in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction? he neuer findes repoſe in any of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: want, cold, heate, or ſome burning, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments him; hee not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to recount his accidents, but alwayes crying, and by this only ſigne, hee ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough diſcouers his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie. After much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:14"/>when he comes to be ſeuen years old, then his executioners lay hold on him; that is to ſay, his Tutors, Maſters, and Teachers of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he growes greater, then he is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned, with Inſtructors, &amp; often diſcourſe, with ouerſeers, with Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and briefly with a great troupe of Lords and Gallants. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, if hee attaine to man-like yeeres, his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries drawe neerer vnto him, being caried from
<pb facs="tcp:177530:14"/>the <hi>Licaeum,</hi> to the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie, into places of publike exerciſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many euils, as well of body as minde. All the yeeres of his youth are ſubiect to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters correction, and to ſuch Tutors as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his youth. When he is gotten once out of this ſtraight, new cares aſſaile and enforce him to reſolue what courſe he ſhould take: and, if we compare the diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of his youth, with thoſe that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb facs="tcp:177530:15"/>ſet vpon him, they will appeare to be but pleaſant and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; and, to ſpeake in a worde, but child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſcar-crowes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other. For, he muſt go to the wars, take blowes, be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall combate, and fight: and then olde age comes on, faire and ſoftly, being the right <hi>rende-uouz</hi> of all cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and remedileſſe euils. If any man be long a dying, and paying of this debt, Nature, like a rigorous creditor, that
<pb facs="tcp:177530:15"/>will be payd at his iuſt day, ſues out an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt her deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; taking from one his ſight, from another his hearing, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And then if thou tarrieſt yet any longer in the world, ſhe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, maimeth, and diſnerves thee. It is true, that ſome haue a long and vigorous old age; but then they renew and verifie the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, which ſayes, that olde men become chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren againe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:177530:16"/>the immortal God, knowing well the ſtate &amp; condition of humane life, hee quickly takes them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, whom he loues beſt. Let <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> and <hi>Trophonius</hi> be witneſſe hereof, who after they had built the Temple of <hi>Apollo Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick,</hi> &amp; prayed inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God, to graunt them that, which would be moſt beneficiall for them, they went to take their laſt ſleep; for the day after they were fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dead. Alſo, the ſonnes of that Preſbytereſſe of
<pb facs="tcp:177530:16"/>
               <hi>Argos,</hi> their mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prayed the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Iuno,</hi> to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penſe their piety and deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in that, wanting horſes, they themſelues had drawen their Mother, in her chariot to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the ſame night, after her prayers made, gaue vp the ghoſt. On the other ſide againe, it would bee a tedious thing, to recite the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets make (theſe being men that prognoſticate of things to come) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their excellent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emes,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:17"/>they deſcribe the condition of all worldly things. At this time, I will only bring forth the teſtimony of a principal man amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them, who affirmes, the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gods to haue ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the life of man ſhould be miſerable; &amp; that conſidering the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes and troubles of all other creatures, they are nothing, in reſpect of the miſery of man. What ſaies <hi>Amphiaraus</hi> to this matter? though <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> loued him ſo dearely aboue
<pb facs="tcp:177530:17"/>all others, yet could hee neuer attaine vnto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect old age. But I will proceed no further, for feare of extending my diſcourſe more largely than I promiſed, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing vpon other matters. But, I pray you, Is there any tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, either of mind or body, wherin thou haſt not ſome iuſt occaſion to complaine? Doeſt thou patiently accept of whatſoeuer is prefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto thee? By the way, let vs but conſider of men of any Arte or
<pb facs="tcp:177530:18"/>Myſterie, which labour night after night, and yet they can ſcarcely therby furniſh their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie wants, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deawing the workes of their hands, with teares, and ſighes. Shall wee come to thoſe that traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke by Sea? Behold the life of a certain kind of men, that cut the waues, amidſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perils and dangers: ſo that <hi>Bias</hi> had verie good reaſon to ſay, that thoſe which ſaile by ſea, were to be eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe, neither
<pb facs="tcp:177530:18"/>liuing, nor dead. For, man being created to liue vpon the earth, hee launches out into the waters (minding at one inſtant to participate of two contrary elements) and caſts himſelf deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly into the armes of Fortune. Thou wilt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſay, that the labour, and tillage of the earth is a pleaſant thing. I agree thereunto: but with how many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is this contentment accompanied? Doth it not bring foorth euery day ſome occaſion of
<pb facs="tcp:177530:19"/>griefe and ſorrow? now rain, by and by drought; to day burning heat, to morrow nipping froſt; and thus, by times, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnſeaſonable ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, or immoderate cold. But, not to inſiſt vpon many other voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of life, to how many perils is the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of States ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, whereof many doe ſo highly eſteeme? The ioy and pleaſure therein comprehended, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth fitly an vlcer, or violent beating of the pulſe: the being put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb facs="tcp:177530:19"/>the ſaddle, in ſuch offices, makes the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious cold at heart, &amp; procures them more diſcontentment, than if they were to ſuffer a thouſand deaths. Can a man be happie, while he liues at the diſcretion of the vulgar, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation (otherwiſe) ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he be in, or though euerie one reuerence him neuer ſo much? ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is but the peoples puppit, who may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade him, hiſſe at him, condemne him to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, bring him to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:20"/>and ſomtimes alſo puts him to death. I demand of thee, <hi>Axio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> becauſe thou haſt ſwayed this Scepter of Magiſtracie, where di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Miltiades, Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Ephialtes,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, and great Captaines which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded them? For my part, I would neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of their ſuffrages, ſuppoſing it a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnproper for mee, to be an aſſociate, or head of ſo dangerous a beaſt, as the common people: but <hi>Theramines</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixines,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:177530:20"/>together with their guarde, ſending Iudges the day after (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted vpon purpoſe) condemned to death all thoſe, that any waies were their oppoſites, without permitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any hearing. As for thee, <hi>Axiocus,</hi> thou, with <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> vpheldeſt equitie, although in the aſſembly there were thirty thouſand of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, &amp; which gaue negatiue voyces. <hi>Axi.</hi> You ſay but truth, <hi>Socrates:</hi> and ſince that time, I haue had enough
<pb facs="tcp:177530:21"/>of ſuch conuentions, &amp; nothing ſeems vnto me more harſh and vnfauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, than the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of publike affairs. They that euer had to do therein, can wel auerre ſo much: as for your ſelfe, you ſpeake but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off, and as one iudging, by the blowes, which haue light vpon others. But wee, that haue played our part therein, may ſpeake by better proofes. In very trueth, my friend <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> the people are verie ingrate, cumberſome,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:21"/>cruell, enuious, euill taught, compounded of the very dregs of men, and of thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, and great moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. I iudge him to be moſt miſerable, that wil bee too familiar with ſuch a beaſt. <hi>Soc.</hi> Why then, <hi>Axiocus,</hi> ſeeing you deteſt the faireſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of all others, what may we ſay of the reſt? muſt wee not ſhun them? But for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, I haue heard this <hi>Prodicus,</hi> adding to the other diſcourſes, this alſo enſuing; that death
<pb facs="tcp:177530:22"/>concerned not either the liuing or the dead. <hi>Axio.</hi> What's this you affirme, <hi>Socrates? Socr.</hi> Why, becauſe Death is no wayes hurtfull to thoſe that are liuing: and for the dead, they are out of his iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therfore now it does not endammage you, becauſe yet you liue: and when you ſhal not be aliue, he can haue no power ouer you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then you are paſt his ſtroake any more. It is therefore but a vaine ſorrowe, for <hi>Axiocus</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:177530:22"/>lament that, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, nor ſhal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after concerne him; no otherwiſe, than as it would be a notable folly to be afeard of monſters which thou ſeeſt not, which preſently haue no exiſtence, and that after thy death haue no beeing. That which is redoubtfull therein, is hideous onely to thoſe, that forge feares to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For, is there any thing that can bring ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the dead? <hi>Axioc.</hi> You haue ſtollen theſe wiſe perſwaſions, from
<pb facs="tcp:177530:23"/>the Orators, that at this day beare all the ſway: for they are the men, that make theſe pleaſant relations, to ſooth, and humor yong men: but I, for my part, am excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding loth, to leaue theſe worldly goods, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you are able to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage vnto me (in your conference) of pleaſing apparance; &amp; my mind findes no perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in this ſmooth courſe of words, which doe but a little delight and tickle in their vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. They beare a
<pb facs="tcp:177530:23"/>good ſhew with them, but they are too remote from truth: and our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations are not fedde with fantaſies; but with things firme and ſolide, that are able inwardly to pearce, &amp; ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. <hi>Soc.</hi> But, <hi>Axio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> you inconſideratlie couple together thoſe things which ſhould not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioined; in making vs beleeue, that to feele euill, and be depriued of good, are the ſelfe ſame things: for the ſuffering of euill, brings griefe vnto him, that loſeth
<pb facs="tcp:177530:24"/>a good. Now, you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, that being dead you are no more; and he that is not, cannot perceiue this priuation: how can he therefore be greeued at a thing, whereof hee ſhall haue no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion? If at the firſt you had reſolued with mee, that in death our bodies are depriued of ſenſe, you would neuer haue been ſo fond, as to feare death: Now, you contradict your ſelfe, in fearing to bee depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of your ſoule; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this ſoule, to your
<pb facs="tcp:177530:24"/>imagined loſſe. For in fearing to loſe your ſenſe, you ſuppoſe by the ſame ſenſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend an euill, which you build vnto your ſelf in the aire, and that you are afraid to feele. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this aboue allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, there are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent arguments, to prooue the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſoule. For, a mortall nature would neuer haue vndertaken ſuch great matters, as to contemne the violence of cruell beaſts, to croſſe the Seas, to build cities,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:25"/>to eſtabliſh publike go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments, to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the heauens, to obſerue the courſe of the ſtarres, of the Sunne and of the Moone, their Eclipſes, and ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, the riſing and falling of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> the Equinoctials, the Solſtice of Winter and Summer, the windes, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent raines, with flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, lightnings, and thunder. She would not haue comprehended in writing, nor conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to eternity, thoſe things that fal out in the
<pb facs="tcp:177530:25"/>world, were ſhe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſome diuine Spirit, to haue the intelligence, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch high and myſticall matters. And therefore, <hi>Axiocus,</hi> thou muſt paſſe vnto an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall life, and not to death: thou ſhalt not be ſtripped of all, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy true goods, thou ſhalt haue pleaſures, no waie intermingled with this mortall body, but abſolutely pure, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectiue, and ſuch as moſt truely deſerue to be called pleaſures. For,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:26"/>thou being looſed out of this priſon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come truely free, thou ſhalt goe vnto a place, where there is no trauel, nor lamentation, from whence ſorrow and old age are baniſhed: thy life ſhall bee exempted from all euill, repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſecure repoſe, and eternal ioyes. Thou ſhalt there behold the nature of al things: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring no more thy mindes trauell, to their affections, who honor thee in this world; but to reſplendent, and moſt
<pb facs="tcp:177530:26"/>excellent verity her ſelf. <hi>Axi.</hi> Thy diſcourſe hath made mee change my mind; &amp; I am now ſo far from fearing death, that contrariwiſe I ardently deſire the ſame: and to expreſſe my ſelfe more magnanimiouſly, I am already, in a maner, out of the world, and begin to enter into theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and eternall paths; ſo that being wholly ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of my infirmity, I am quite become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man than that I was before.</p>

But, I think that old man to be very miſerable, which in the ſpace of ſo long time before, neuer lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that death ſimplie was not to bee feared, but rather to bee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:27"/>if it deſtroy the ſoule, as ſome thinke: but according to my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, it ought to bee deſired; ſeeing it leades man to a place where he ſhall liue eternally. Wee cannot finde any one betwixt theſe two opinions. What ſhould I then feare, if I either feele no miſery at all, or if I ſhall bee happie after death? Beſides this, is ther any man ſo fooliſh, how yong a Gul ſoeuer he be, to ſuppoſe, that he hath a Patent of his life, but til the euening?
<pb facs="tcp:177530:28"/>He is ſo farre from that, that euen youth it ſelf is ſubiect to many more kinds of death than old age: yong men ſooner fall into diſeaſes, they are more grieuouſly ſicke, and hardlier hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: ſo that it is rare, to ſee men liue to bee olde. If this were not, wee ſhould liue more wiſely, and happily: for old men are indued with the vnderſtanding of counſel and wiſedome; and without them, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths could not ſtand on foote. But, let
<pb facs="tcp:177530:28"/>vs come to this feare of preſent death: and in that, olde age is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully charged to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to this apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; feeing this is a more common accident with youth. For my part, I felt in the death of my ſonne, &amp; your brothers, of whom great hope of good, hereafter, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that death threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens all ages. Some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may reply, that a yong man hopes to liue long: which one aged, cannot expect. This hope, is truely the hope
<pb facs="tcp:177530:29"/>of a yong man, that is to ſay, of a light head. For, is there a greater ſottiſhnes, than to make ſure and certain of that, which is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and vnſure? But an old man hath no reaſon in the world to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue any ſuch hope: and I affirme that his condition herein, is far better, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a yong mans, in that he hath obtained what the young man doth but hope for; and that is long life, which the olde man hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I pray you, what
<pb facs="tcp:177530:29"/>length doe you find in a mans life? fet down vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, the longeſt of all others: Let vs conſider the age of the King of the <hi>Tarteſsians;</hi> for I find in bookes, that one <hi>Arganthonius</hi> reigned foureſcore, and liued ſixeſcore yeeres: but I ſee that ther is nothing long, but tendeth to ſome period; the which being attained vnto, all the reſt is gone and paſt, ther remaining nothing but what thou haſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Iuſtice and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie. The howers paſſe
<pb facs="tcp:177530:30"/>away, ſo doe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths: that paſt, neuer returnes againe, &amp; what will come hereafter we knowe not. Euery one muſt be contented, with the time allotted him to liue. For, as hee that playes a Part vpon a ſtage, needes not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the whole Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die from one end to the other (to make him be accompted a good A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) ſo that in the Part which he properly plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he giue contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the ſpectatours: no more is it requiſite, that
<pb facs="tcp:177530:30"/>the wiſe man ſhould liue as long as the oldeſt man that euer liued in the worlde; becauſe a ſhorte life is long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for a man to carrie himſelfe therein honeſtly, and vertuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And ſo if our dayes ſhoot out at length, we muſt be no more weary of them than labourers, that after the beautie of the Spring time, ſee Summer enſue, and then Autumne. For, the Spring time reſembles youth, and makes ſome demonſtration of the
<pb facs="tcp:177530:31"/>fruits which afterward muſt be reaped. Other ages are proper, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lay vp the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the earth: and the fruit of olde age, is the remembraunce of thoſe goods which wee haue formerly purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: whatſoeuer is done according to nature, we may place in the rank of good things. But, what is more naturall, than to ſee old men die? The ſame falles out to youth: but, ſomewhat againſt Nature; and, as it were, in deſpite of her: ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:177530:31"/>when yong men die, me thinkes I ſee as it were a great fire, quenched by an huge quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: where as contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, old men droppe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, like to a fire that quencheth of it ſelfe. And, euen as apples, but greene and vnripe, fall not from the trees, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we violently pluck them off; &amp; being ripe, they fall off without v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any great force thereto: ſo alſo young men ſeeme to die, not
<pb facs="tcp:177530:32"/>without ſome violence offered to their nature: &amp; old men quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The which ſo cheares mee vp that the neerer I approach vnto death, the neerer I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne my ſelfe to hale in with that harbor, and port, where I pretend to anchor, after ſo long, &amp; dangerous a nauigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. All the ages of our life, are limited but only old age, wherein wee liue vertuouſly, as long as the means yet remaines to labour in our vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and otherwiſe, to
<pb facs="tcp:177530:32"/>hold death in contempt: the which may bee the reaſon alſo, that old age is more ardent and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, than youth. This is that, which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> anſwered to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Liſiſtratus,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vertue, wherewith he ſo braued him, and was alwaies oppoſite to his deſignes, becauſe, ſayd <hi>Solon,</hi> I am old: but the ende of this life is then moſt ſweet, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, when the ſame Nature which built, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faceth alſo her worke,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:33"/>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man til the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his ſenſes, &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, entire. For euen as the Carpenter, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect, can eaſily, when he liſts, plucke the ribs and beames of his ſhip aſunder, or the other plucke downe that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which he had ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: euen ſo, Nature moſt properly diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a man, whom ſhee before had ſodered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of two ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent pieces: now, al kind of Soder, and congluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation lately made, is hardly diſſolued; but in
<pb facs="tcp:177530:33"/>that old and long worn, it is otherwiſe: and ſo the remainder of life is not much deſired, or ſighed after, by the aged; who haue reaſon rather to be ready to diſlodge, expecting minutally the great Captains coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, which is God: without whoſe will and pleaſure, as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſayd, wee are prohibited to leaue our Guariſon, &amp; <hi>Corps du guard,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are conſtituted in this worlde. There is a notable ſaying, aſcribed to the wiſe <hi>Solon,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:177530:34"/>hee would haue his friends to mourne and lament his death: which makes me thinke, that his meaning onely was herein, that they ſhould ſhewe, to haue made great accompt of him. But, the Poet <hi>Ennius,</hi> peraduenture hit better vpon this point, when he forbade his death to be lamented, or that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mourning funerals ſhould bee performed: he ſuppoſing, that ſuch a death was not to bee deplored, which was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by immortality.
<pb facs="tcp:177530:34"/>For the reſt, if there bee ſome ſenſe or feeling in death, and in our laſt gaſpes, it laſts not long, eſpecially in a very aged man: and as for any fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling after death, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing at all, or elſe a thing to be much deſired. But wee muſt haue learned betimes to contemne death: for without this Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, none, can haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny repoſe in minde; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is moſt certaine, that die wee muſt, not knowing when: and it may be, at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:35"/>or inſtant of our thought. How can that man therefore enioy a peaceable ſoule, if hee fear death, which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens him, euery minute of his life? I neede not dilate more at large, of this, wen I call to mind, not only <hi>Lucius Brutus,</hi> who was ſlain in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery of his countrey; or of the two <hi>Decij,</hi> who viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cly plunged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the one, within an huge deepe Dell; and the other within a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion of armed men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom he verily
<pb facs="tcp:177530:35"/>thought to haue beene ſlaine; or <hi>Marcus Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who couragiouſly returned to cruell pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to loſe his life, than breake his oath, which hee had plighted to his enemies; and the two <hi>Scipioes,</hi> that expoſed their bodies to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies furie, for the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a paſſage; or <hi>Lucius Paulus,</hi> who by his owne death, defaced the temerity &amp; raſhnes of his collegued Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull, in the diſcomfiture of the Romanes at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:177530:36"/>and alſo <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> who being dead, was honored with a Toombe, by his moſt mortall enemie: but I will alſo ſet before your eyes our moderne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, which haue often-times chearefully, and with noble courage aſſaulted thoſe places, from whence no one of the troupes, euer hoped to come off. Should it be ſayd, that learned old men, doe feare that, which youth, and thoſe ruſticall &amp; ignorant, for the moſt part, valiantly
<pb facs="tcp:177530:36"/>deſpiſe? And moreouer, me thinkes the being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied with all things elſe, makes one alſo well ſatiſfied with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Infancie hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſports and recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, which young men deſire not to put in practiſe. Old age feeles no contentment in the pleaſures of youth; and men of auncient yeeres, ſeek not after that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men delight, that are yet in the flower of their age: and olde age diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the very laſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of our life;
<pb facs="tcp:177530:37"/>but yet in ſuch ſort, that all in the end vaniſheth away, as the exerciſes of precedent times haue done: the which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to paſſe, to bee ſatisfied with liuing, clearely ſhewes, that then it is high time to die. For my part, I ſee nothing that hinders me, from ſetting down my opinion touching death: and me thinkes, I may ſpeake thereof, with good motiue, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it appeareth ſo neer vnto me. Out of doubt, <hi>Scipio,</hi> &amp; <hi>Laelius,</hi> I thinke
<pb facs="tcp:177530:37"/>that your fathers, which were honorable men, &amp; my beſt friends, though dead to the world, doe yet liue; and ſuch a life, as onely deſerues to bee ſo called. For, while we are incloſed within theſe ſtraite precincts of the body, we trauell, and we muſt (will we, nill wee) yeeld, vnto the yoak and burden; the celeſtiall ſoule, and off-ſpring of the higheſt Tabernacle, being ouerwhelmed, and, as it were buried in earth, this being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary habitation to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:38"/>and a diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But, I beleeue, that the immortal Gods haue planted ſoules in humane bodies, to the end there might be peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to repleniſh, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the beautifull courſe of heauenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp; to imitate them, in conſtancie, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar life. Beſides many reaſons and arguments, which haue induced me to beleeue this, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and reputation of the greateſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, hath much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb facs="tcp:177530:38"/>me: I haue heard ſay, that <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and the Pythagoreans, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times named the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers of <hi>Italy</hi> (&amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, inhabitants of our countrey) were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of opinion, that our ſoules were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from Diuinity. I haue vnderſtood alſo of <hi>Socrates</hi> his diſcourſe (who was iudged by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> to be the wiſeſt man of the world) toward the later part of his life, about the immortality of ſoules. What neede wee any
<pb facs="tcp:177530:39"/>more? behold my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion herein. Seeing the ſoules of men are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant, ſo retentiue and mindfull of things paſt, foreſee ſo diſcreetly thoſe to come, haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented ſo many myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and diuers other worthy Sciences, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent matters, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that a nature capable of ſo great good, ſhould be mortal. And the ſoule hauing perpetual motion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiuing any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, conſidering that ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:177530:39"/>onely moues of her ſelf, it muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that ſhe ſhall haue this motion for euer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee can neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon her ſelfe. Alſo, in that the nature of the ſoule is ſimple, there concurring in her no mixed difference, ſhee cannot be diuided. And ſo, being iudiciall, ſhe is by conſequent immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. For, this is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt proofe, that men are intellectual, before their being born, in that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, learning the moſt difficult Sciences, doe
<pb facs="tcp:177530:40"/>ſuddenly comprehend ſuch an infinitie of things, that we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they begin not then to knowe what is, but onely remember, &amp; call againe vnto minde: Theſe are almoſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of <hi>Plato.</hi> On the other ſide, the great <hi>Cyrus,</hi> of whome <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> hath written at large, at the hower of his departure, ſayd thus vnto his children: My deare beloued, though I remaine no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, yet do not thinke, for all this, that
<pb facs="tcp:177530:40"/>I haue afterwardes no more being, nor am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in any place; for when I was in your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, you could not perceiue my ſoule: but only you imagined it to be within my body, by my exteriour actions. Beleeue therefore, that this ſoule remaines ſo ſtill, although you ſee the body no more. The vertuous ſhould not be honoured after death, if their ſoules had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their memoriall long time before their
<pb facs="tcp:177530:41"/>death. I could neuer yet bee perſwaded, that if ſoules liue within mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies, that euer they can die, iſſuing out of the ſame: or that the ſoule going out of the body, which of it ſelfe is ſtupid and ſenſeleſſe, becommeth then alſo inexiſtent, &amp; inſenſible: but, on the contrary, when ſhe is freed from all commixtion with this body, ſhee then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to be pure, and entire; then ſay I, ſhee is mounted vnto the height and top of all
<pb facs="tcp:177530:41"/>wiſedome. Moreouer, it being ſo, that humane nature, is diſſolued by death, wee plainely ſee whither all other things tend, that is to ſay, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from whence they were firſt extracted; the ſoule onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the which wee neither ſee enter, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne, nor iſſue out of the body. But, for the reſt, you ſee there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which ſo truely reſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bles death, as ſleep: And, the ſoules of them that ſleep, clearly in this point ſhew their diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:42"/>that being free, and in repoſe, they foreſee things to come; which plainly argues their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after their relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from theſe corporall bonds. The which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, honor mee then as a thing diuine: but if the ſoule were to periſh with the body, yet for all this, forbeare not to feare the Gods, which ſupport and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne this principall worke of theirs, that is called man; the which (like to good children) performing, you ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:177530:42"/>inuiolably preſerue the memoriall of my name. This was <hi>Cyrus</hi> his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, a little before his death: But if I ſhall not herein bee too bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom vnto you, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what I will deliuer vnto you, in mine owne behalfe. No body ſhall euer perſwade me, O <hi>Scipio,</hi> that either your predeceſſors, or other men of great note, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not requiſite to name, would euer haue enterpriſed ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable exploits to all poſterities, but that they
<pb facs="tcp:177530:43"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world was to no other ende, but to procure the good of their ſucceſſors. Think you (to ſpeake plainely, and after the manner of old men, which loue to ſet foorth themſelues) that I would haue ſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled, both day and night, in warre &amp; peace, if my renowne, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhould finiſh with this preſent life? would it not be better then, to liue idle, and in repoſe, without any trouble or vexation? But, my ſoule,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:43"/>I know not in what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, gathering together new forces, regardeth happineſſe, with ſuch a penetrant eye, as if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting this world, ſhee ſhould but only then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to liue. And if it were otherwiſe, that ſoules were not immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, honeſt men would not aſpire vnto a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall glory. What is the meaning of this, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery wiſe man dies wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; and the wicked with great grief? Think you not that the ſoule, which ſees farre clearer,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:44"/>and further off, knowes well, that ſhee is going to a better place? and, on the contrary, hee which hath an heauie and diſturbed ſoule, ſees not the like. Surely, I deſire nothing more, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee your Fathers, whom I haue honoured and cheriſhed. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the deſire which I haue to drawe neere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that I haue knowen, I would willingly alſo talke with thoſe of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue heard, which ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto mee by their bookes, and
<pb facs="tcp:177530:44"/>whoſe names I haue ſet downe, amongſt mine owne writings. Now that I drawe neere vnto them, it would diſpleaſe me much to hang back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or to bee rowled downe againe, as wee might doe with a round ball. And if ſome God had permitted me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe, into my infancie, and to crie in my cradle, I would very conſtantly, and flatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſuch an offer: for, ſeeing I haue almoſt run my race, I would not be called backe again from
<pb facs="tcp:177530:45"/>my goale, to the firſt ſetting forward. Is ther any true commoditie in this life? Is it not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, through al the periods thereof? But, admit there are ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities therein, yet are we far from finding ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or obtaining of our wiſhed ends and deſires. I will not raile againſt the ſame, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers learned men haue often-times done; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repent I, that I haue liued: for I haue ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my time, that I am of opinion, I haue done
<pb facs="tcp:177530:45"/>ſome good in the world: I goe out of this life, as out of an Inne, not as out of mine own houſe; ſeeing Nature hath ſent vs forth hither, for a litle time, to paſſe forward in our iourney, and not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually here to inhabit. Oh, happy will that day be, when I ſhall depart to this celeſtiall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of ſoules, and leaue the raſcallitie of this world: for, I ſhal not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then, bee with thoſe good men, aboue-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but alſo with mine owne ſonne, one of the
<pb facs="tcp:177530:46"/>beſt men, that euer the earth brought foorth: whoſe body I haue ſeen brought to aſhes; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in reaſon, hee ſhould rather haue ſeen the like by mine. But ſee: his ſoule neuer leaues mee, but continually fixing her lookes vpon me, ſhe is flowen vp now into thoſe places whither ſhe knowes that I muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I bare this loſſe patiently, as it appeares: but yet I confeſſe that I was much trobled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; euer comforting my ſelfe, with this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:46"/>that ther ſhould bee no long ſpace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her departure and mine.</p>

Theſe be things which the diſcipline of each cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey enioineth, and layeth vpon euery one. What then of this? Marry hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we muſt
<pb facs="tcp:177530:54"/>conſider that againſt all kinds of darts, againſt al kinds of enemies, there is not any thing more properly preualent, than to make no reckoning of death: which ſurely no man doubts, but that it hath in it ſome thing terrible, that offends our mindes and courages, which nature hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and framed, with a loue of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; for otherwiſe there were no neede of any preparation or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of our ſelues againſt that, whereunto
<pb facs="tcp:177530:54"/>we all did willingly run, out of a naturall inſtinct and deſire, as wee vſe to goe in caſes of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and defence. Out of queſtion, no man learnes how he ſhould lie, if need were, vpon a bed of roſes; but, how hee might endure tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rather than to ſpeak any thing againſt his faith; how, if neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie required, hee might paſſe an whole night without ſleep; being ſore wounded, how to be wary of leaning ſo much as againſt a Pike,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:55"/>for feare ſleep ſurprize him not, when he thus reſts himſelf. But, death hath no diſcommodity in it at all. For then ther muſt needs be ſomthing in the ſame thus incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious. For, if thou deſireſt greatly long life, thinke that of all things, which are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from thine eyes, and are concealed in nature (by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either they are already, or preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to be brought forth) nothing is cleane conſumed. They finiſh, indeede, their time, but ſo they
<pb facs="tcp:177530:55"/>periſh not: And, the death, which wee ſo much feare and flie, takes not from vs life, but, giues it only a truce, and intermiſſion for a little time: A day will come, to bring vs again to that light, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would feare, but that they ſhall be reduced to ſuch a ſtate, as wherein, they ſhal not remember whatſoeuer is paſt. But hereafter I will more preciſely declare, that all this, which ſeemes to periſh, doth onely but change. He ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb facs="tcp:177530:56"/>willingly, that goes to come backe againe. Obſerue how all things returne in their due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Thou mayeſt ſee, that in this world there is nothing vtterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, but it deſcends, and aſcends againe by turnes. The ſummer, is it paſt? The next yeere brings it againe. The Winter, is it done? his due moneths will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it again. Hath the night obſcured the ſight of the Sunne? why, the next day will diſcouer it againe. The courſe of
<pb facs="tcp:177530:56"/>the ſtarres is performed through the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which before they paſſed. Alwayes, ſome part of the heauens ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vp, &amp; another goes downeward. In briefe, to conclude, I affirme, that neither children, nor mad men feare death: and how baſe a part would it then bee, that reaſon ſhould not be as able to furniſh vs with ſecurity, as they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by their ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and idiotiſme?</p>

For, making no great account of future time, I labor to liue wel, before old age; &amp; in my olde age to die well. To dy wel is no other thing but to die willingly. Take a courſe, that in all things which requiſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou muſt performe, thou doeſt not anything by compulſion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and neceſſitie, is for thoſe that reſiſt: and not for thoſe that doe

Afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare me, with this Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, the ordinary age of

And yet of this age, let vs but conſider how much is ſpent in griefe, how much in cares, how much in the conceit of death, before it comes to our wiſhed deſire; how much in ſickneſſe, how much in fears, &amp; briefly, how much in our yong and vnprofitable yeers: And, notwithſtanding, of all this we euen ſleep out the moity. Adde
<pb facs="tcp:177530:71"/>hereunto, the troubles, ſorows, and daungers: you ſhall ſee, that in the longeſt life of all, the time which we truly liue is the leaſt of al. Life is neither good, nor euill, but it is the place of good or euill. Hee that dies in his youth (in that by all likelihoode hee might aſwell haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired as ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded) is like one that hath loſt a die, wherwith he might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue loſt, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> won. In briefe, for the breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of age, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to the infinitie
<pb facs="tcp:177530:72"/>of time, we are al equally young and old: for the moſt extended age of a man is but as a point, or minute.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:177530:73"/>being ſatisfied in all theſe things, I will lead it in repoſe and quiet. Beleeue, that euen to thoſe, deemed moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, all things are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: No man can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any thing to him ſelfe of future things; and that which we hold, ſlippes euen out of our hands: that hower it ſelf, which we inſtantly run, ſome incommodity or other, glides betweene our fingers. Time paſſes away, according to a certaine and immutable lawe, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed from
<pb facs="tcp:177530:73"/>vs. Now what haue I to doe, whether this bee certain, and knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Nature or not, ſeeing it is vncertaine, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen vnto me? We many times propound vnto our ſelues long na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigations, &amp; not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe in a long time, while we haue run vaging about, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering many ſtraunge coaſtes: wee propound to our ſelues the wars, and the ſlowe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of our military indeuours; briefly, of place, honours, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement

And, in the meane while, Death comes vpon vs, without euer thinking thereon, if it bee not ſometimes expoſed to our eyes, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of others morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: which takes no longer impreſſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in our mindes, than wee woonder at the ſame.

Euery one allotteth his life, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things: they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and ſparing in holding their patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but prodigall in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of time; of time, I ſay, wherein auarice is onely honeſt, and not ignominious. But chuſe we one, out of the troup of the moſt ancient in yeares: Verie wel Sir, wee ſee you haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:177530:91"/>to the very toppe of humane nature, euen as farre, as a mans age may poſſiblie reache. You goe on the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeer, or more: wel, cal your yeers a little to an accompt. Of all this time, tell me how much your creditor hath taken from you, how much your Loue &amp; Miſtreſſe, howe much the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-wealth, how much your friend; then after this, how manie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts you haue had with your wife, what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you haue inflicted
<pb facs="tcp:177530:91"/>vpon your ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, what running vp and downe the citie you haue been driuen vnto, for your familiars, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Annexe hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the diſeaſes which you haue fallen into, by your owne default: and adde alſo, vnto this, that which remained, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any good imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: Thou ſhalt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee, that thy yeers are fewer, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou makeſt reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. Cal to mind, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thy ſelfe, thou wert reſolute in any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, how many daies
<pb facs="tcp:177530:92"/>paſſed away conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to that which in thy minde thou diddeſt ſet down; how many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profited thee: when thy countenance was freſh, thy heart without feare, what great neede you had of ſo long a life: then, how many ſundry men haue as it were ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and impaired it, you no wayes perceiuing, when, or what you loſt: how much hath ſome cauſeleſſe griefe taken away from you, ſottiſh contentments, ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauory deſire, or flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:177530:92"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation: brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after all theſe abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, how little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that was proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thine owne; and then thou ſhalt ſee, that for al this thou dieſt, before thou art ful ripe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy beſt time. Who is the cauſe hereof? Why, you liue as thogh you ſhould liue for euer. Good husbandry neuer comes into your mind; you neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider what time is ſpent and gone; you ſpend and waſte, as though you had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; you feare like a
<pb facs="tcp:177530:93"/>mortall man, and couet all, like one immortall: Heare what the moſt of them vſe to alleage. At fiftie yeers I will betake my ſelfe to mine eaſe, when I am threeſcore yeer old I wil giue ouer all publike office: I pray ye tell me, where made you purchaſe of ſuch a long life? who gaue you Letters Pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for liuing a longer time? who can haue the patience, while theſe things take effect, euen as you haue ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; ſet them downe? Art thou not aſham'd to
<pb facs="tcp:177530:93"/>reſerue the refuſe of thy life only to wiſdom, and aſſigne ſuch an age vnto that, which can no more be imployd in anything elſe? Oh, it is too late to begin then to liue, when we muſt leaue liuing. Is not this a ſottiſh obliuio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of out mortal nature, to defer good &amp; healthfull cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, til the fiftith yeer, and to begin to liue at ſuch yeers, vnto which fewe euer attaine vnto? Thou ſhalt many times heare the greateſt and mighti'ſt perſonages vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words to this effect,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:94"/>that they deſire repoſe, they commend, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it before all other goods: They would, if ſecurely they might, giue ouer all the ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and triumph, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they liue. That great Emperour <hi>Augustus,</hi> to whom God vouchſafed more fauours than to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, ceaſed not to ſigh after this repoſe, &amp; to wiſh for vacations, that hee might bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from publike negotiations: all his ſpeach tended, for the moſt part, to this ende.
<pb facs="tcp:177530:94"/>This reſt &amp; tranquillity ſee med vnto him ſo precious a thing, that not being able effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to enioy it, he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it in conceit. He which ſaw all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on himſelf, which impoſed on all nations what ſtood with his will and pleaſure, thought that day moſt happy, when hee might but lay aſide his worldly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He knew wel, how great toile, the goods of Fortune, which are ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable vpon earth, put vs to, and how many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb facs="tcp:177530:95"/>cares they harbor. It would but bee ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, to make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diuers, that vnto others appeared to bee very happie, and yet they themſelues proued faithfull teſtimonials to the contrary, when the whole accounts of their yeeres were caſt vp. But by theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints, they could neuer perſwade others nor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: for euen at the very inſtant, when ſuch wordes eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them, their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s returned to their olde wont. Out of queſtion,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:95"/>though our life ſhould extend euen to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres, yet would it be reſtraind, &amp; brought into a little compaſſe; the ſeuerall ages would conſume al that: &amp; that ſpace, which although Nature conceale, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might exſpatiate, if it were well guided, it muſt needs flie from vs in a moment. For, wee redeeme not this time, wee doe not retayne, nor ſlacken it, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſpect and induſtrious in all things; but doe rather ſuffer it
<pb facs="tcp:177530:96"/>to rowle away, as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous thing, that may bee againe recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Throughout our whole life, wee muſt learn to liue: and, which is yet more ſtrange, through euery hower of our life, we muſt learne to die. There haue been many great men, that leauing their places, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their eſtates, offices, and pleaſures, in the height of their age they ſought after no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but to knowe how to liue well: and yet the moſt of them
<pb facs="tcp:177530:96"/>left this life, confeſſing euen then, they had not attained to this vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Euery one hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on his life, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels in the deſire of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things, and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of preſent times: but he, which beſtowes his whole time in this practiſe, and truly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all his dayes, in ſuch a life, neither deſires nor feares, what may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the day after. What comes to paſſe? how bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſoeuer thou art, thy life paſſeth away; and Death wil preſently ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
<pb facs="tcp:177530:97"/>thee: for then (will ye, nill ye) you muſt bee at leaſure. They acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate their liues with their liues expence and charge, they diſcourſe and caſt aboue the Moone. Now the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt loſſe, that can bee in life, is retardation: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, takes vp the firſt yeeres, and plucks from thee things preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, while it promiſeth thee thoſe future. An attending life procures great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which loſeth to day, and depends on to morrowe. Thou diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
<pb facs="tcp:177530:97"/>of that, which is in the handes of Fortune, and leaues that at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that is in thine owne. Wheron caſteſt thou thine eye? what wouldeſt thou attempt? All future things are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie; wouldeſt thou knowe why the elder ſort liue not long? Why, but obſerue, how olde men, euen when they doate, deſire longer life: They beg by vowes, and prayers, the prorogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a fewe yeeres. They conceit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:177530:98"/>to be yonger than they are, they are flattered with fantaſies, and are as ſillily gull'd, as if they meant at an inſtant to go beyond both Death, and Deſtinie. But if any infirmitie put them in mind, that they are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; Oh, how daſtardly they die! It ſeemes not that they goe, but rather that they are haled out of this life. Then they can ſay, how they had been fooles; and that, by reaſon of their follie, they had not liued out halfe their life: but, if
<pb facs="tcp:177530:98"/>they could eſcape this diſeaſe, they would liue quietly, and abandon all affaires. Then they call to mind, how they had borrowed, in vaine, that which they were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to enioy; and that all their labour, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, is now come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe, and they onely liue, which finde time and leaſure, wherein to learne wiſedome. For, they doe not only beare their yeares well; but, they adde all the time paſt, vnto their owne.
<pb facs="tcp:177530:99"/>All the yeeres, which paſſed before them, they haue ouertaken: and ſo we likewiſe, if we be not too ingrate. The famous Authors, of theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent &amp; ſacred opinions, were born for our ſakes, they prepared a life for vs. By other mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors we are conducted to admirable things, drawen and digged out of darkeneſſe, to bring them to light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. There are no ages forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into al. And when we take pleaſure, out of a
<pb facs="tcp:177530:99"/>great minde, to iſſue a little out of the ſtraight ſiege of humane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillitie, there is fitte time enough to fetch our walkes abroade at large. We may diſpute with <hi>Socrates,</hi> doubt with <hi>Carneades,</hi> take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with ſome, &amp; with others vanquiſh, and ſubdue humane nature. Now, ſeeing Nature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth vs to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of all ages paſt, let vs not therefore loſe this little and fraile paſſage of time, but addict our
<pb facs="tcp:177530:100"/>ſelues with our whole hearts, to things ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, eternall, and that participate with the beſt. Theſe people, that hitch from office to office, that importune both others and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, when they haue well ſcudded the ſtreets, trotted ſoundly vp and downe, from gate to gate, when there is not an open doore but they haue peept in at, when they haue ietted, with ſalutations from one houſe to another; in an huge citie, tranſported
<pb facs="tcp:177530:100"/>away with other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, how many would there bee, that they ſhould neuer ſee? how many that will abſent themſelues from them, and ſende them away with a flea in their eare, becauſe they would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſleep, or paſſe their time in laſciuiouſneſſe? Let vs therfore be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of better offices: All men, whatſoeuer, may, when they will, haue priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with <hi>Zeno, Pythagoras, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus, Aristotle, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus</hi> and with other
<pb facs="tcp:177530:101"/>principall and famous Authors of good and liberall Sciences. Hee ſhall find none of them otherwiſe occupied, none but he wil find lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to entertaine him, none that will not ſend him back, more happy, more content, and more deſirous of his amitie, none that will let him depart emptie handed.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, thoſe whom he ſeemes to flatter, and ſpare, he doth but wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, &amp; effeminate them, for euils to come. Why doth God afflict the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort, with ſickeneſſe, griefe, and diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities? Why, in a camp, are the moſt perillous actions commited to the moſt couragious, and valiant? Why doe Captaines ſende out choice ſouldiers to giue the enemie a <hi>Camiſado,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:177530:111"/>to diſcouer a way, to winne a paſſage, and to driue them away that guarde the ſame? There is none of them will ſay, my Captaine hath done me wrong; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee holds mee in great eſteem: The ſame muſt they alleage, that endure euils ſent from God, whereat cowards, and effeminate men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God thought vs worthy, as in whom to make triall, how much humane nature is able to ſuffer and endure. Shun pleaſures, flie this feeble
<pb facs="tcp:177530:111"/>and effeminate felicitie, which diſtempers &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenerates the hart, drow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning it in a perpetuall drunken ſleepe, if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there happen not another contrary acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to put him in mind of his humane conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Ah, is it not farre better to ſupport a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall infelicitie, which inuiteth vnto vertue, than to ſtoope vnder an infinite burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities? And therfore God deales with honeſt men as maſters do with their ſchollers, who ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
<pb facs="tcp:177530:112"/>greateſt leſſon, &amp; taske, of whom moſt hope is conceiued. I pray you tell me, Doe you thinke that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> hated their children, when they made ſuch a triall of their nature, and condition, as to whip them publikely? Their fathers themſelues, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated them to beare couragiouſly the ierkes of the whips: and being lamentably laſhed, and halfe dead, they yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted them to adde laſh vnto laſh. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell then, though God
<pb facs="tcp:177530:112"/>tempt, and hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirits. To bee in dayly daunger, makes vs lightly eſteeme the ſame. Thus are the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Mariners har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened vnto the Sea. Thus growe knobs in the poore Labourers hands. Thus are the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers armes trained vp to throwe a dart: The members of thoſe that runne, made nimble to paſſe the race. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that part is ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt in any one, that moſt is exerciſed. There
<pb facs="tcp:177530:113"/>is not ſo firme nor ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide a tree, as that which the winde ofteneſt bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpon: for, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus beaten and blaſted, it knits toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſpreadeth his rootes more firmely in the earth. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo, that I heard this couragious ſpeach from <hi>Demetrius:</hi> O immortall Gods, ſayd hee, I complaine of you for this one thing, that you made mee not ſooner to vnderſtand your will: For, I would haue come thither of
<pb facs="tcp:177530:113"/>my ſelfe, whither I goe now, but beeing ſent. Will you take away my children? Why, here they are. Will you haue away one part of my bodie? why, take it freely. It is no great matter, which I promiſe: for I muſt leaue it all, ere it bee long. Will you haue my ſoule? Why not? it belongs not to mee, I will not hinder you, from taking that which you haue giuen me: you ſhal, with heart &amp; good will, haue whatſoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:177530:114"/>you demand. But what then? I had rather offer it my ſelfe, than giue it, when I am demanded: what need you to haue taken it away from me? You may indeede take it, but you ſhall not take it from mee; for nothing is taken away, but from him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts: but I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, I endure it not againſt my will, &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I yeelde not to God, but onely conſent to his will. The fire tries gold, and myſery men of courage. But why then
<pb facs="tcp:177530:114"/>doth God endure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries done to good men? Why, quight co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, hee doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it. He remoues all euils, far off from them, wickednes, ill thoughts, corrupt counſels, couert luxuries, and auarice, which is alwaies prying into other men. Hee guardes them himſelfe, and keepes them cloſe by him: would any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture require of God, to guard their goods and chattels alſo? They diſcharge God of this labour, in making
<pb facs="tcp:177530:115"/>no account of externall things. Among others, <hi>Democritus</hi> remooued all his wealth farre off; he ſuppoſing, that it would but bee a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to a good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Imagine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that God thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto thee; Why complaine yee of mee, you that haue deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in equitie? I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed others with falſe proſperities, &amp; oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied their ſpirits with a long and lying dream. I haue outwardly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with gold, ſiluer,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:115"/>&amp; Iuory, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are of no value. Thoſe which, at the firſt ſight, ſeem happy, if you but obſerue them well, not in the place where you meet them, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſome where elſe, they are ſordid, baſe, and miſerable, and are but like their owne walles, outwardly painted, &amp; ſet forth. This is not true, and perfect felicitie: it is but a rinde or barke; and that alſo, but ſlight, and thinne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while they can hold out, &amp; ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:177530:116"/>in no place, but where they like beſt, they glitter, and abuſe mens iudgements: but if an accident fall out, that doth but diſcouer, and diſplay them, then we may eaſily perceiue, what deepe villany lies hid vnder adulterate ſhewes. But, to you, on the contrary, I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen certaine goods, and thoſe that wil continue. The oftner they are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or beheld on euery ſide, the better and more reſplendent they will ſeeme; which is to ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:116"/>lightly to eſteem of any thing that is feared, and to diſdaine that which ordinarily is deſired: you doe not ſhine outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: all your goods ſtand inward. So doth all this world: it contemnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of it ſelfe: All the wealth thereof is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

            <p>This fals out, my deare brethren, for want of faith: Men thinke, that what God promiſeth (who is truth it ſelfe, and whoſe word is eternall, and inuiolable towards thoſe that beleeue) ſhuld not be performed. If any honorable ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and place, ſhould promiſe thee this, or that, thou wouldſt make account of it, beleeuing that he, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be very obſeruant

God promiſeth vnto thee perpetuall &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life at thy departure out of this world: doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou thereof? This is the true ignorance of God, to offend by incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, Ieſus Chriſt, the Doctor of all beleeuers, to liue faithleſſe, in the houſe of faith, which is the Church. Chriſt the
<pb facs="tcp:177530:126"/>Author of our good &amp; ſaluation, ſhewes the profit which redownds vnto vs, by death: when hee obſerued his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſadneſſe, becauſe he had told them of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of this world, he ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, If you loued mee,
<note place="margin">Iohn 14.</note> you would be ioyfull for my going to my Father: teaching vs by this, to bee merrie, and not ſad, when our friends doe but as it were diſlodge out of this life. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being mindfull of ſuch a matter, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb facs="tcp:177530:126"/>therof in one of his Epiſtles, and ſayeth; Chriſt is gaine vnto me both in life and death: he reputing it for a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull gaine, to bee no longer detained by the ſnares of this world,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> to be no more ſubiect to the ſinnes and vices of the fleſh, to bee exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all afflictions, deliuered from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels iawes, and to goe into the ioyes of eternal ſaluation, whither his Sauiour called him.</p>
            <p>Some wonder, to ſee the heate of this diſeaſe,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:127"/>lay hold on Chriſtians, aſwel as on Infidels: as if Chriſtians had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the promiſes of the Goſpel, to bee touched with no diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities before the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſame, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy at their pleaſures, the happineſſe of this world: whereas on the contrary he is tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a thouſand e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils here below, that by this means he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how eternal ioyes are reſerued for him. But whereas we finde it ſtrange, that the plague
<pb facs="tcp:177530:127"/>ſhuld ſweep away Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, aſwel as Infidels; haue we any priuiledge in this worlde, from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo long as we are clad in this mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, correſpondent to the lawe of our firſt birth? While we liue here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, wee are ioyned with other men, by the bonds of this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fleſh: but ſo in ſpirit wee are ſeparated from them. While therefore this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble puts on incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our mortall parts be made immortall, and
<pb facs="tcp:177530:128"/>that we aſcend to God our Father, all the diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the world are common to vs, and we haue our ſhares ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with other men. For example, when any Froſts procure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earths ſterility, euery one hath his part in the famine enſuing: If an enemie take into his hands any towne, all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants loſe their liberty together: when the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are cleare and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, all are conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to endure this drought: and if the
<pb facs="tcp:177530:128"/>rockes ſplit a ſhippe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, the paſſengers periſh. We are ſubiect, as others be, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of the eyes, to burning agues, and to all kinds of diſeaſes, that afflict all the members of the body, as long as we liue a mortall life in this world, aſwell as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. Nay, and if a Chriſtian man doe but well vnderſtand, vpon what couenants hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in God, hee will conceiue, and be clearly reſolued, that he ought to bee in conflict, more
<pb facs="tcp:177530:129"/>than others, by reaſon hee hath a continuall warre aboue all others, againſt the diuel.</p>
            <p>The holy Scriptures teach &amp; admoniſh vs of this: ſaying, My ſonne, when thou entreſt into Gods ſeruice, bee firme in righteouſnes; feare, and prepare thy ſoule for temptation. Alſo, perſeuer in ſorrowe, and feare, be patient in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie; for yron tryes both golde and ſiluer.

<note place="margin">Tob. 2.</note> Thou ſoundly feeleſt now, the euils which thou endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: but, hee being ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the loue of God, and armed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence

And when thou didſt bury the dead with

            <p>The righteous alwaies ſhewed themſelues pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and the Apoſtles knew well the Lordes meaning herein, that his ſeruaunts ſhould not murmure in aduerſitie; but couragiouſly, and patiently endure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:177530:132"/>fell to their ſhare in this world. There was no ſinne that the Iewiſh people ran oftener into, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this of murmuring, and impatience againſt God; as he himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he addeth, Let them ceaſe from deſpiting me, and they ſhall not die. Deareſt brethren, wee muſt not murmure in aduerſity, but patiently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly indure whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer may happen, calling to minde what is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that an afflicted ſpirit is an acceptable ſacrifice

               <pb facs="tcp:177530:132"/>vnto God; and that hee reiects not the humble and contrite hart. The holy Ghoſt alſo ſpeakes by the mouth of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> The Lord thy God ſhal afflict thee, &amp; ſend thee famine, to make thee looke into thine owne hart, whether thou kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or no.

Thou, which canſt not looſe thy ſonne, hee being ſubiect to death as others are, what wouldeſt thou doe, if God ſhould ſentence thee, to put thy ſelfe to death? Faith &amp; the feare of God, ſhould make thee ready to performe whatſoeuer his pleaſure is. Though thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt thy goods, though diſeaſes vexe and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

There can bee no Victorie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:177530:134"/>the battel fought: if after the comming to hand-blowes, the fielde bee left by either ſide, then the victor obtains a glorious crowne. A good Pilot is diſcouered in the ſtorm, and a good ſouldier in the conflict. It is but ridiculous, to braue and brag, when blowes are far off: to ſet vp the briſtles againſt aduerſitie, is a certaine brand and marke of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The tree, deep roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the earth, is not ſhake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the bluſtring of windes, the ſhip that
<pb facs="tcp:177530:134"/>is well keeled, and ſtrongly ribbed, may well bee toſſed, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pearced by the waues: when wee win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowe the corne in the open ayre, the ſounde graine feares not the winde, which quickly blowes away the ſtraws and chaffe. Euen ſo the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> after his ſhipwracks, whippings, long and durable affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of body, proteſted, that ſuch trials hurt him not at all, but rather did ſtand him in great ſtead, ſo that in the full
<pb facs="tcp:177530:135"/>courſe of all theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, hee profited the more in good. An angel of Sathan,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> ſaid he, the ſting of my fleſh was ſent to buffer mee, for feare that I might bee puffed vp: for the which I thrice prayed vnto the Lord, that it might bee remooued from mee; and hee ſayd, Let my grace ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice thee, for my vertue is perfected in infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. When as therefore ſome infirmitie, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or other aduerſity doth rage, then our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb facs="tcp:177530:135"/>is made more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: If proued faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer, at laſt it is crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: according to that which is ſayd, that the furnace tries the potters veſſels; and temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, righteous men. For the reſt, they which knowe not God, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from vs in this point, that they murmure and complaine in aduerſity: and, contrariwiſe, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are ſo farre from diſtracting vs, from pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and Iuſtice; that wee are rather fortified by them amidſt griefes,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:136"/>and ſorrow it ſelfe. If the bloody fluxe did weaken vs, if heate make the infirmities of our mouthes more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, if our ſtomacke be ſore with continuall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, if our eyes looke red like blood, if any one loſe his feete, or other members, when hee is conſtrained to cut them off, becauſe they are ready to fal away in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; if by diuers la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guors &amp; maladies, happening to the body, the ſtrength of the legs come to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, the hearing be
<pb facs="tcp:177530:136"/>deafened, or the ſight dulled, all this learnes vs to profit more and more in the grace of God. What notable valour is this, to enter couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly into the field, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo many plagues and euils? Can any man obſcure his excellencie, that ſtands firme, amidſt ſo ſundry reſolutions, without declining or falling to them, that put not their truſt in God? Hee muſt vnfainedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and thinke the time well employed, when in making trial of
<pb facs="tcp:177530:137"/>his faith, and trauailing couragiouſly, we march vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſtrait gate, to receiue from Chriſt our Iudge the reward of our faith, and of eternall life. Let him feare death, who hauing neuer beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate with water, and the ſpirit, is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hell fire. He that hath no part in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe and death of Chriſt, hee that enters by the firſt, into the ſecond death; he, that when he leaues this preſent life, is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb facs="tcp:177530:137"/>flames: hee, that onely ſtands, through Gods patience, whoſe ſorrow and griefe is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differred, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: Let ſuch an one, I ſay, feare death. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our brothers are dead of this plague, which is to ſay, many of them are deliuered out of the worlde. As ſuch a mortalitie is a plague to the Iewes, &amp; Painimes, who are Chriſts enemies; ſo is it a comfortable depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the ſeruants of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:177530:138"/>
            <p>Though the iuſt die, aſwell as the vniuſt, yet think not that good men die the like death as the wicked. The children of God are taken into a place of eaſe, &amp; repoſe; but the reprobate are drawen to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of eternal fire: the beleeuers are preſently taken into protection; and the infidels receiue ſuch puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as they deſerue. My deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we are euill adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, being ingratefull &amp; forgetful of Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, &amp; not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:177530:138"/>the graces, which he hath beſtowed vpon vs. See how our daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters carrie their honor vnſpotted out of this world, fearing neither the menaces, violation, or villanies, of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſts religion: yong lads haue, by this means, eſcaped the ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery paths of youth, and haue happily gotten the goale, to obtaine the crowne of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, and innocencie: the tender woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> needs no more to feare tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hauing gained
<pb facs="tcp:177530:139"/>by a light, &amp; eaſie death, this priuiledge, that the hang-mans hand hath now no power ouer her. The time, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſuch a death heateth the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme, confirmes the feeble, rowſeth the ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, conſtraineth thoſe reuolted to returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, induceth Idolatrers to imbrace the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, procures the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that, of long time, haue made proieſſion of this Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to repoſe; &amp; they lately
<pb facs="tcp:177530:139"/>come into the Church, in great number, gather aſſured ſtrength &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to fight, without any feare of death, when dangers preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; being entred into the skirmiſh, in ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and perillous a time. Furthermore, dear brethren, is it not a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, that by this mortall maladie, the thoughts and affections of euery one ſhould be reuealed? We may now ſee whether the found
<pb facs="tcp:177530:140"/>will aſſiſt the ſicke, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one kinſman, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God, hath loued another; if Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſlaues lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing; if Phyſicians haue viſited thoſe pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, that implored their helpe, if the inſolent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained their violence, if theeues and pilierers, by the feare of death, haue giuen ouer their inſatiable thirſt of aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, if the proud haue bowed their heads, if the wicked haue bridled their impudencie, and
<pb facs="tcp:177530:140"/>briefly, whether the rich, that haue loſt their children, &amp; neereſt kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſeeing themſelues now deſtitute of heires, &amp; ſucceſſors, doe diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their almes liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the poore.</p>
            <p>And though the plague ſerued to no other end, but to put into Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans a deſire to ſhed their blood for Religion, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſuch a time not to fear death, this would bee a ſingular benefit. This viſitation is rather an exerciſe, than a death vnto vs: It giues occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:177530:141"/>to the mind to glory in the force giuen vnto it, and making death co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, it diſpoſeth vs to run haſtily to the receiuing of our crown. But ſome body perhaps will replie, and ſay, That which grieues me in this mortalitie, is, that being prepared to maintaine Religion, and feeling my ſelfe diſpoſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure death couragiouſly and ioyfully for Gods name, I am depriued of this benefit, by the preuention of death. I anſwere firſt, That to
<pb facs="tcp:177530:141"/>ſuffer for Ieſus Chriſt, lies not in thine owne power, but is a gift of God: and then, thou canſt not iuſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, for loſing of that, which peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture was not requiſite for thee. For the reſt, God which ſearcheth and knoweth the heart, and the ſecret thoughts thereof, ſees thee; &amp;, if thou ſpeakeſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a pure &amp; vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hart, he approues &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mends thy good will; and diſcerning the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which hee himſelfe put into thee, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:177530:142"/>thee for the ſame. When <hi>Cain</hi> offred ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto God, hee had not yet killed his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned his paricidie, not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, hauing diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his deep malice, and pernitious determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and euen ſo, when the ſeruants of God ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly reſolue and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſtoutly to maintaine the trueth, with the expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their owne blood, God who ſees their good mindes and hearts doeth crown
<pb facs="tcp:177530:142"/>them, aſwell as if they had performed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. There is a great difference, between ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that will was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Martyrdom, and that martyrdome was wanting to will. Such as God findes thee, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cals thee, ſo he iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf proteſts, ſaying, And all the Churches ſhall knowe, that I ſearch the reines, and hart. For, in other reſpects, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands not our blood, but our faith. Neither <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Iſaac,</hi> nor <hi>Iacob</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:177530:143"/>were ſlaine: and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, they are ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked amongſt the chiefe Patriarkes, bearing the titles of faith, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes; &amp; whoſoeuer is faithful, iuſt, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of prayſe, he comes to the table, &amp; banquet of theſe Patriarkes.</p>
            <p>To reſume our former diſcourſe, let vs call to mind, that we muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme Gods will, and not our owne; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that prayer, which Ieſus Chriſt hath taught vs. What is it, but to diſturbe, &amp; ouer throwe
<pb facs="tcp:177530:143"/>all piety, when deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the wil of God may be fulfilled, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyle, and drawe backe, when he would take vs out of the world. When we thus hang taile, and like rebellious ſlaues, come not in our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters preſence, but with euill will, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, leauing the world, becauſe it would be a fault to doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, &amp; notthrough any deſire we haue to reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied in the wil of God, how can we requeſt, at his hands, the heauenly
<pb facs="tcp:177530:144"/>rewards, to which wee doe not approach, but by compulſion? Why doe wee pray, that his kingdome may come, ſeeing wee take ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to remaine in the priſon of the worlde? Why heape we prayers vpon prayers, that the general reſtauratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all things may approach, if our greater, &amp; more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate deſires would rather ſerue here below, the enemie of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to raigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue with Ieſus Chriſt? But, that the teſtimonies
<pb facs="tcp:177530:144"/>of diuine prouidence may the better be layed open, &amp; that we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the Lord (who fore-knoweth all things to come) hath care of his childrens ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, it ſo happened, that one of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the Miniſterie, being pluckt downe by this diſeaſe, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himſelfe neere to death, demaunding the Euchariſt, as if hee aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God, and had bin drawing his laſt gaſp, an honorable yong man, very maieſticall, high of
<pb facs="tcp:177530:145"/>ſtature, and welfauoured of countenance, being ſo relucent, that no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eye could firmely behold him, appeared, &amp; was ſeen by this man, being rather out of, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this worlde. Then this glorious yong man, with a lowd voice, and as it were in choler, ſaid vnto him ſicke: You feare aduerſitie, you would not willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue; what ſhould I do vnto you? It is a voyce, which chides, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth vs, &amp; iumps not with their deſires
<pb facs="tcp:177530:145"/>which feare perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and care not for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide ſtill for hereafter. Our brother, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in dying, learned a thing, which all ſurui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants ought to thinke vpon: for, he vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, when hee went out of the world, it was told him, to the ende, that he ſhould deliuer it vnto others, and hee vnderſtood it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for himſelfe, but for vs. For though he haue need to learn, that is ready to goe out of
<pb facs="tcp:177530:146"/>this world, yet this man learning at his laſt hour, he was liuely admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to the end that we, which ſuruiue after him, may learn to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that which is expedient, and neceſſary for vs. How often haue we, of little faith, vnderſtood? how ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath the Lord vouchſafed to teach vs? How often hath he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded mee, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and preach, inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly before you al, that you ſhould not lament for your brethren, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſeth God to call,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:146"/>and to deliuer them out of this worlde, ſeeing I knowe, that they do not periſh, but precede, and go before thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine behind; and that we may be grieued, or a little touched for them, as for friendes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue to ſome other place, or that embarke themſelues, to arriue in a good Port: But wee muſt not lament, nor weare mourning weeds for them, here belowe on earth, ſeeing they haue now put on white roabes in heauen: We

<pb facs="tcp:177530:149"/>For, this our temporall death, it is but a paſſage vnto immortality, and we cannot attaine to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life, before we diſlodge, and remoue out of this world.

To this end we read, that <hi>Enoch</hi>

            <p>The holy Ghoſt alſo teacheth vs by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of the wiſe man,

<note place="margin">Wiſd. 4.</note> The iuſt man, ſaith he, was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, to the end that malice might not depraue his vnderſtanding: for his ſoule pleaſed God, and therefore made haſte to be remooued from out the midſt of iniquity. In the ſelf ſame maner, the faithfull &amp; deuout ſoule runs a great ſpirituall paſe, towards her God, ſaying:

            <p>For the reſt, it belongs

<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.</note> nor the things that are in the world. If any man loue the worlde, the loue of the Father is not in him. For, all that is in the world (that is to ſay, the concupiſcence of the fleſh, the deſire of the eyes, &amp; the pride of life) are not of the Father, but of the world. The world, and the deſires thereof paſſe away: but hee that performes the will of God, liues for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, euen as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is eternall. Let vs therefore, deare brethren,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:152"/>attend patiently, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God ſends, with a pure vnderſtanding, an aſſured faith, and a conſtant reſolution. Let vs driue away, far from vs, the apprehenſion of death, and bee mindfull of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> immortality which is to ſucceed. Shew we our ſelues ſuch, as our profeſſion imports, not to lament the death of our frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds; but our hour being come, let vs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and chearfully goe to the Lord, when hee calles. For, ſeeing Gods ſeruants ſhould bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

We haue ſeene, and paſſed many dangers: theſe are but ſlight euils, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe that are to come: we may therfore thinke our gaine great, in going out of the ſame ſo quickly. If the wals of thine houſe ſhake with age, if thy roofe totter, if thy hole edifice, not being able any longer

Behold the world, how it ſhakes, and is ready to diſſolue, manifeſting in the ende, her vtter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine: Why therfore thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou not on God?

            <p>Wee muſt conſider, deare brethren, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly meditate, how we haue renounced the world; &amp; that we reſide therin, but for a time, as pilgrims and ſtrangers.

We call Paradiſe our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,

               <p>BVt there are three kindes of death: The firſt is the death of ſinne: of which it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> The ſoule which
<pb facs="tcp:177530:162"/>ſinneth ſhall die. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, death myſticall, when any one dies to ſinne, and liues to God: of which the Apoſtle ſayth, that wee are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with Ieſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> in his death by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. The third is, the end of our courſe &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in this worlde, which is to ſay, the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſoule from the body: we ſee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ther is an euill death, that is, when we die in ſin; another, good; wherin whoſoeuer dies, he is deliuered from ſin;
<pb facs="tcp:177530:162"/>and the third, betwixt both; for honeſt men repute it good, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtand in feare of it. Though it deliuers all men, yet are there but a few that take pleaſure therein: but, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from any vice that is in death, that is, in the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, but from our infirmities; in that giuing our ſelues ouer to the pleaſures of the fleſh, and delights of this life, wee are afrayde to ſee ſo quicke an ende of this our earthlie
<pb facs="tcp:177530:163"/>courſe, wherin notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there is more gall, than honie. Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, &amp; ſuch as feare God, haue alwaies done otherwiſe; for the long continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels in this world, made them to mourne, and think it much better, to bee ſeparated from this body,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> to bee with Ieſus Chriſt: ſo that ſome of them haue growen to ſuch a point, as to deteſt the day of their birth: witnes he who ſaid,
<note place="margin">Iob 3.</note> And let the day, wherin I was borne, periſh. For, what
<pb facs="tcp:177530:163"/>pleaſure is ther here in this life, ful of anguiſh &amp; care, repleniſhed with a million of calamities &amp; miſeries, with the tears and lamentations of the afflicted, wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all conſolation? Therefore it is, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> in his booke of Eccleſiaſtes, rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4.</note> and further addeth: Nay, and I thinke him better than them both, that neuer was borne; for he neuer ſawe the wicked workes that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:177530:164"/>vnder the Sunne. In another place hee holds opinion, that the dead infant, is in better ſtate and condition, than an olde man, by reaſon hee neuer ſawe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils that are wrought in the world, hee neuer came into this darknes, he neuer walked in the vanities of this preſent life: and therefore, he that neuer entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlde, enioyes more peace &amp; repoſe, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he that is come into the ſame. And in deed, what good can a man
<pb facs="tcp:177530:164"/>reape in this world, that walkes therein but as an image, and can neuer be ſatisfied with the deſires thereof? If there be any wealth to deuoure, hee loſeth his peace, being conſtrained to haue his eye alwaies ouer that which with miſerable greedines he ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, moſt miſerably to poſſeſſe that, which can ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him in no true ſtead: could there be a greater ſlauery, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee a man labour to amaſſe, and heap thoſe goods toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that bring him no

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. This end is death: and comfort is a good thing; it followes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that death is a good thing. That was the cauſe, why <hi>Simeon</hi> ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced: who knowing that hee ſhould not die before he had ſeene the annointed of the Lord, when they brought Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus into the Temple, he tooke him in his armes, and ſayd, Lord, thou let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb facs="tcp:177530:165"/>now thy ſeruant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace, as if hee before had remained in this life, rather by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, then of his own free-will, hee requiring to be ſet at libertie; as if being hampred in ſome bonds, he had then gone to take poſſeſſion again of his freedome. This bodie is as it were chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yea, and (which is worſe) with the chaine of temptations; which ſhackles, bindes, &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments outragiouſly, by reaſon of the cruelty of ſinne. For, we ſee in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:166"/>how the ſoule of man loſeth it ſelfe, by little and little, from the bands of the fleſh, and beeing let out by the mouth, flies away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered out of the dungeon of this body. <hi>Dauid</hi> made haſte to go out of this temporall courſe, ſaying, I am a ſtranger,

And, therefore, <hi>Dauid</hi> addes: Let me retire my ſelfe, ſuffer that I may bee refreſhed, before I goe, and be no more. Why pant we therfore after this life, wherin the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger any one remains, the more he is ſurchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſin? The Lord himſelfe ſayth, Euery
<pb facs="tcp:177530:167"/>day is content with his owne miſerie.
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> And <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> complained, that the hundred &amp; thirty yeeres of his life,
<note place="margin">Gen. 47.</note> were ſhort, and irkſome: not that the dayes were tedious of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but becauſe malice here increaſeth, as the dayes paſſe away. For, there is not a day that paſſeth ouer our heads, wherein wee doe not offend. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſayde very well:
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> Chriſt is gain vnto me, both in life and death: in the one, hauing relation to the neceſſity
<pb facs="tcp:177530:167"/>of his life, for the ſeruice of the Church; and in the other, to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular benefit, which he receiued by dying: as wee alſo liue in ſeruing of Chriſt; towards who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his ſeruants muſt needs ſhew their good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in deliuering vnto others the doctrine of his Goſpel. And as for <hi>Simeon,</hi> who ſaid: Now thou ſuffereſt thy ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, hee ſtayed becauſe of Chriſt, who is our King; ſo that wee may not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nor reiect his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:177530:168"/>men were there, that the Romane Emperors cauſed to remaine in remote, and ſtrange Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, in hope of future recompenſe, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors? Came they from thence without their maſters leaue? and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all compariſon, is it not a more excellent thing to obey the will of God, than of men? CHRIST therefore is gaine to the beleeuer, as well in life, as in death: for in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of a ſeruant, hee refuſeth not to ſerue in
<pb facs="tcp:177530:168"/>this life; and as a wiſe man, hee embraceth the gaine of death. It is a great gayne to bee out of the harueſt of ſinne, to be remooued from euill, and in full poſſeſſion of good. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo addeth, My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is to remooue, and be with Chriſt, which were far better for me: but, for you, it is more neceſſary, that I ſhould remaine in the fleſh. Hee ſet down this word neceſſary, by reaſon of the fruit of his trauels; and the worde better,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:169"/>by reaſon of his celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al grace, and thriſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie coniunction with Chriſt.</p>

               <p>SEeing then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teacheth, that whoſoeuer leaues this mortall bodie, goes to Chriſt, if he hath truely knowen, &amp; ſerued him: let vs a little conſider, what death, &amp; what life
<pb facs="tcp:177530:169"/>is. We knowe, becauſe the holy Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre it, that death is a looſing of the ſoule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, and, as it were, the ſeparation of a man: For, in dying, the ſoule is diſioined fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. <hi>Dauid,</hi> therefore, ſeems to allude hereun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to when he ſayes: Thou haſt broken my bonds;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.</note> I will offer thee ſacrifice and praiſe. The prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent verſe of this Pſalm, becauſe the death of the Saints is precious in the eyes of the Lord, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that by theſe bonds
<pb facs="tcp:177530:170"/>is vnderſtood, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of our bodies, with the ſoule. And therefore, foreſeeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then, that hee was in the number of thoſe faithfull, that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly rendred their liues into the handes of Chriſt, he reioyceth on his part; hee alſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully offring vp himſelfe for the people of God, to fight with huge <hi>Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath</hi> hand to hand, and by himſelfe alone, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the opprobrie, &amp; peril, which then threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the people of God:
<pb facs="tcp:177530:170"/>In which, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelfe frankly vnto death, to appeaſe the wrath of God, being readie in the name of all others and for their comfort, to beare the ſcourge of GOD: he knew well, that it was farre greater glory to die for Chriſt, than to raigne in this world: can there bee a more excellent thing, than to offer vp our ſelues vnto CHRIST?</p>
               <p>Although therefore, the Scripture ſpeaketh of diuerſe Sacrifices
<pb facs="tcp:177530:171"/>of <hi>Dauid,</hi> yet is there a mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, in this Pſalme, which ſayth, I will ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto thee praiſe, and thankeſgiuing: hee ſaid not, I doe ſacrifice; but, I will; minding hereby to inferre, that a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is then perfect, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery beleeuer is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the bandes of this body, to appeare before the Lord, &amp; then preſents himſelf to him in a ſacrifice of praiſe; becauſe no praiſe, nor thankſgiuing, is perfect, or accompliſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:177530:171"/>death: and no man can be truely praiſed in this life, by reaſon of the vncertaintie of that to come. Death therefore is a ſeparation of the ſoule from the body; for that which further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, we ſaid before, howe S. <hi>Paul</hi> declared, That to be diſſolued, &amp; be with Chriſt, he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a farre better thing than to tarrie here ſtill. What elſe procureth this ſeparation, but the diſſolution of the bodie, and bringing of it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; &amp; as for the ſoule,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:172"/>it is her freedome, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to peace, &amp; ioy, that is to ſay, to liue with Chriſt, if it beleeue. The chrildren of God, therefore, do nothing in this worlde but purifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minations of the body, which are as bands to tie vs in, &amp; labor to free the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, renouncing of pleaſures, ſhunning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutenes, &amp; the flames of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Is it not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true, that euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoule, liuing here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, is conformed and
<pb facs="tcp:177530:172"/>ioyned vnto death, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſtudies to die in her ſelfe to all carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and to all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and allurements of the world. Thus was the Apoſtle dead, when hee ſaid:
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> The world is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to mee, and I to the world. In fine, to the end wee might knowe, that death is in this life, and that it is good, he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs to bear in our bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death, or mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord Ieſus: for, he who hath in him the death of the Lord Ieſus, hee ſhall haue his

There is a good life after death; that is to ſay, a great felicitie after victory, a good life at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of the combate, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the law of the fleſh, can no more contradict the lawe of vnderſtanding; when death ſtriues no more againſt the bodie, but that the victory ouer death is incloſed in the ſame. And I knowe not whether of theſe two are more effectual:
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> this life,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:173"/>or this death; conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Apoſtles au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentike teſtimony, who ſayth, Death therefore is neceſſary in vs, &amp; life in you. How many nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were reuiued by the death of one man? The Apoſtle then as you ſee,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> teacheth, that thoſe who enioy this preſent life, muſt alſo deſire this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent death; to the ende that the death of Chriſt may appeare in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and that wee may participate of this feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, by which our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal man is deſtroyed,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:174"/>to the end, that heauens manſion place may bee open vnto vs. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conformes himſelf well vnto death, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires from the earneſt deſires of the world, &amp; that looſeth the bands, wherof the Lord ſpeaks in <hi>Eſay:</hi> Looſe the bands of vnrighteouſnes,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 51.</note> break the obligations of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt exchange: let them goe free, that are tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder foote, vntie the knots of wickednes. Hee approcheth neere vnto death, that ſtrips himſelfe of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb facs="tcp:177530:174"/>of the world, that diſintangleth himſelfe, from terreſtriall cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and raiſeth his minde to the heauenly Tabernacle, within the which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was conuerſant, euen while he liued here belowe: otherwiſe hee woulde not haue ſayde,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> Our conuerſation is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: the which may alſo be applied to the zeale &amp; meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man: for his thoughts were there, there his ſoule frequented, the ſtudies and indeuours of
<pb facs="tcp:177530:175"/>his minde, were raiſed vp thither, the limits of this body being indeed too ſtrait, to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the apprehenſions of a man truely wiſe; who aſpiring to ſuch a good, ſeparates, for the time, his ſoule from his body, and hath no more to doe with the ſame, in contemplating of that trueth, which he deſires openly to ſee; for which cauſe he ſeekes nothing more, than to bee freed from the ſnares, &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this body. For, wee cannot with our
<pb facs="tcp:177530:175"/>hands, with our eyes, or our eares, conceiue this celeſtiall trueth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe things viſible are temporall; and thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, eternal. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, our ſight is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deceiued: and we diſcerne things farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than indeed they are: our hearing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deceiues vs; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee muſt looke to inuiſible things, if wee will not bee deceiued. When may we then be aſſured, that our foule is not deceiued? When is it that ſhe layes hold on
<pb facs="tcp:177530:176"/>the throne of veritie? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when ſhe is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, which then can abuſe, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue her no more? The ſame deceiued her by the regard of the eyes, &amp; by the hearing of the eare: &amp; therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that ſhe ſhould leaue &amp; abandon it. And therefore the Apoſtle minding to ſhew, that it was not by bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but by the eleuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſoule, &amp; the harts humility, that had found out the trueth, he ſayth, that our conuerſation is
<pb facs="tcp:177530:176"/>in heauen. He therfore ſought in heauen, that which is trueth, and ſhal ſo remaine for euer. And thus retiring his thoghts and all the force of his vnderſtanding, without reuealing himſelfe to any other: but knowing and conſidering well of himſelfe, reſoluing to followe that, which he tooke to bee trueth, and perceiuing that to be falſe, &amp; flitting which the fleſh deſires, and chooſeth fraudulently; he rightly blaſoned this body, calling it the body
<pb facs="tcp:177530:177"/>of death. For, who can diſcerne, with his eyes, the brightneſſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Who can gripe righteouſneſſe with his hands, or ſee wiſedom with his bodily eyes? Briefly, when we medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on any thing, wee would not willingly ſee any body, we like not to heare any noyſe about our eares; hauing ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our minds ſo fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as wee ſee not that, which is before our eyes. And in the night our cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are more firme, and we conceiue
<pb facs="tcp:177530:177"/>the better of that in our hearts, which ſerues for our document and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; where-vnto that ſaying of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in the 4. Pſalme, hath reference: Ponder with your ſelues, vpon your beds. Often-times alſo, diuers men cloaſe their eyes, when they would profoundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of any affaire, auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at ſuch a time the impediment of ſight. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles we ſeeke out ſolitarie places, to the end, that no body may trouble vs, or by his
<pb facs="tcp:177530:178"/>prattle turne vs out of the right way, into ſome ſtraying and by-path. Euen ſo this bodie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures diuers occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which dull the ſoules point, and ſlacken our intentions: ſo as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man <hi>Iob,</hi> ſaid well to this purpoſe;
<note place="margin">Iob. 10.</note> Thou haſt made mee of clay and ſlime. If this body be of clay, we are onely plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered therewith: but it diſſolues not, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers the ſoule, with the filth of his Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Thou haſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled me (ſaith he) with
<pb facs="tcp:177530:178"/>skin, and fleſh: thou haſt interlaced me with bones and ſinewes. So that our ſoule is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and extended tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the ſinewes of the bodie: many times ſhee is as it were ſtiffe, and otherwhiles crooked. Hee addeth, Thou haſt not exempted me from iniquitie: but if I bee wicked, accurſed be I: &amp; yet if I were iuſt, I durſt not lift vp my head, becauſe I am all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; for thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed me with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: What is this life,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:179"/>but a place ful of ginnes and ſnares. We walke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the nets, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe in the thickeſt of many daungers. Before, <hi>Iob</hi> had ſaid, The life of man, is it not a battell vpon earth? It is very materiall that hee ſaid, vpon earth; for there is a life for man in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
<note place="margin">Iob 7.</note> His life (addeth he) is like a labourers work, (which is to ſay, ſpent in toy! e and trauel) conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it ſelfe in vanities, ebbing away in words, hauing a manſion place in duſt, a life in ſlime,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:179"/>and clay, without reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, or conſtancie. In the day he deſires night; before he eates, he cries, and weeps at the time of his repaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but teares in this life, grief, feare, careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, inceſſant troubles, trauell without ſolace, anger, and horrible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Many wiſh death, &amp; cannot obtaine it: if they obtaine this good, they reioice; becauſe it is only death, that brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth a man to repoſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BVt I heare ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, how it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that God made not Death: that life was in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> wherein God had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Tree of life, and life is the light of men; and ſo conſequently the death that entred in is euill. I demaund in what ſenſe, one may
<pb facs="tcp:177530:180"/>tearme it euill, if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of the heathen, it hath no more feeling? or if, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle, Chriſt is gaine, with whom it were better to be? How then can death be an euill thing, if after the ſame wee haue no feeling at all? For where there is no ſenſe of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, there can bee no griefe, ſeeing to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, is to feele ones ſelfe euill: Or if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſenſe, and ſeeling after death, there is then life after death,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:181"/>and the ſoule which v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſenſe, and hath life, ſuruiueth the body after a ſeparation by death. But ſeeing the life and ſoule remain after death, that which is good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, it not being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihillated by death, but contrariwiſe it is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented: for there is no impediment of death, that can detaine the ſoule, but ſhee labours with the more efficacie, being intentiue on thoſe things that properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto her without being tied to the body;
<pb facs="tcp:177530:181"/>which in ſtead of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, ouerchargeth, &amp; makes the ſoule to ſinke vnder her burden. What euill then receiues the ſoule, if it be maintained in puritie, that is to ſay, in the knowledge and feare of God. But if ſhe haue done otherwiſe, death, notwithſtanding, is not euill; but the life, which was not a true life: for, wee cannot rightly call the courſe &amp; race of mankind, a life, which is ſo dayly aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and corrupted by ſinne. Why then doe
<pb facs="tcp:177530:182"/>we accuſe death, which doeth giue the reward of life, or elſe which fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the afflictions, &amp; miſeries of the world. I conclude therfore, that either death enioyes the happines of his repoſe, or is tormented by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the euill of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent life. Now, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me this point well: If life be a burden death is then a diſcharge, and releaſement thereof: if life bee a puniſhment, death is a deliuerance: if there be any iudgement after death, there is then
<pb facs="tcp:177530:182"/>a life after death: Shall wee then ſay, that ſuch a death is not good? Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as life heere belowe is good, how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death out of the world be euil, ſeeing there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, which wee neede to feare, during this life? What makes this mortall life good, but pietie, &amp; righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? Life therfore is not good, in reſpect of the ſoule &amp; bodies vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but becauſe by the feare of God, it putteth to flight this euill, and obtaines the happineſſe of death,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:183"/>more performing that which concerneth the good of the ſoule, than that which pertaines to the ſociety and coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſoule &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy together. If we call life good, which is the mirrour of the ſoule, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the body, and if the ſoule be good, which raiſeth and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it ſelfe from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the body: out of queſtion death is good, which frees and deliuers the ſoule, from the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and company of the body. In what ſenſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:177530:183"/>ſoeuer wee take it, death is good, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeparates two aduerſe parties, for fear leſt they ſhould ruine one another; and in that it is a Port of refuge to thoſe who hauing ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vp and downe the ſea of this world, ſearch by faith the hauen of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; as alſo becauſe it makes not our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worſe, but reſerues vs to a iudgement to come, ſuch as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly wee are found: hereunto may be added, that it holds vs at reſt, it
<pb facs="tcp:177530:184"/>withdrawes vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their malice, that ſuruiue in the world, and repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth vs with the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe things, which before we deſired &amp; expected. To this we may alſo annexe, that it is in vain, for men to fear death, as if it brought an end to Nature. For, in calling to minde, that God made not Death; but man, after he fell to ſinne, receiued the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his diſloyaltie, and reuolt, which was, that he ſhould returne to duſt, out of which
<pb facs="tcp:177530:184"/>hee was framed, wee ſhall finde, that death is the ende of ſinne; for feare, leaſt if life had beene prolonged, ſinne might the more haue augmented. The Lord therfore ſuffered Death to enter into the world, to the ende, that ſinne might ceaſe. And to preuent, that Nature might not end in death, he hath ſet down a day, when all ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: ſo that Death doeth extinguiſh ſinne, and makes our nature perdurable for euer.
<pb facs="tcp:177530:185"/>And thus death is the portion of all the liuing. And thou muſt paſſe it with a good courage: for, ſo we go from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to incorruption, from death to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, from labor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Let not therefore the very name of death terrifie thee: but rather reioice in the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of ſo excellent a paſſage. For what other thing is death, but the funerall of our vices, and reſurrection of our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues? and therfore there was one that ſaid very
<pb facs="tcp:177530:185"/>truely: Let my life die the death of the Iuſt, which is to ſay, let it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, for the laying aſide of imperfections, and putting on of that grace which is imparted to all the faithfull, which bear the mortification of our Lord Ieſus, in their ſoule and bodie. Now, this mortification conſiſts in the remiſſion of ſinnes, in the wiping away of offences, in the obliuion of error, and in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of mercie: what can we ſay further of the benefit of death,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:186"/>except wee ſhould alſo once more adde, that the world was thereby redeemed.</p>

               <p>BVt I pray you, let vs deliuer ſomwhat of the death which is common to all. Why ſhould we feare it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it procures no hurt or preiudice vnto the ſoule? For, it is written: Feare not them, which kill the bodie, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:177530:186"/>kill the ſoule. Now by the meanes of this death, the ſoule is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, being ſeparated from the bodie, and diſintangled from theſe troubleſome ſnares. For which cauſe, while we are in this body, let vs prepare our ſelues for death, let vs rayſe our ſoules aboue the bedde of our fleſh: and, to ſpeake aptly, let vs riſe out of this ſepulchre, let vs retire from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of the bodie, let vs leaue all earthly things, to the ende that
<pb facs="tcp:177530:187"/>the aduerſary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, hee may find nothing, that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs to him, in vs. Let vs cheerfully march towards this eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pineſſe, let vs mount vp, &amp; with the flight of loue &amp; charity, ſoare vp from hence, which is to ſay, from theſe fraile and worldly things, hearing this exhortation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord: Riſe vp, depart from hence; minding that euery one ſhould leaue the earth, reforme his ſoule, which hangs backward, lift it vp to heauen, rouſe vp his
<pb facs="tcp:177530:187"/>Eagle-flight, that hee may enioy the benefit of this promiſe;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.</note> Thy youth ſhall be renewed, as that of the Eagle: this was ſpoken to the ſoule. Let our ſoules therfore ſoare vp aloft like the Eagle: for ſhe flies aboue the cloudes, ſhe glitters &amp; ſhines again, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation of her plumes, ſhe raiſes her flight, euen vp to the skies, where ſhe cannot be intrapped by any ſnare: for, the bird, which deſcends fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aloft downeward, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-times take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the

And ſo let our ſoules al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take heed, of deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downe vpon the earth. There is a ſnare in gold, and ſiluer is limed: there be nets in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and prickes in the pleaſures of this world. In running after golde, the ſnare layes holde on our neckes, in ſeeking after ſiluer, wee are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the lime: and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe our feete in poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the nets catch vs. Why contend wee after that gaine, which

Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulteries, wrath, choler, and all other paſſions, are ſo many ſpikes which are faſtened in our
<pb facs="tcp:177530:189"/>ſoules, and that pearce our very bowels, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes. Let vs therefore ſhun theſe euils, &amp; raiſe vp our ſoules to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſimilitude of God.

<pb facs="tcp:177530:195"/>for, within our bodies there are too many, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad, on euery ſide, which we ought to ſhunne. We muſt not committe the guard of our ſelues to this body, nor mingle our ſoules therewith. Ioine with thy friend, and not with thine enimie: thy fleſh is thine enemie, becauſe it contradicteth the law of vnderſtanding, and contends after nothing, but to ſowe enimities, ſeditions, quarrels, and troubles: Mingle not thy ſoule therewith,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:195"/>for fear thou confound, and defile it altogether. For, making this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy fleſh, which ſhould be ſubiect, comes to contemne the ſoule, which ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as Souereign, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe giues life to the body; and the fleſh on the contrary, effects the death of the ſoule. This would therefore bee an ouerthrowing of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and almoſt a confounding, both of the one and other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Shall wee then affirme, that the ſoule
<pb facs="tcp:177530:196"/>receiueth into it ſelfe, the inſenſibilitie of a dead bodie? and that the body likewiſe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with the vertues of the ſoule?

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the light, for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; though it pearce into euery place, yet is it not for all this mixed therewith: Wee muſt not therefore confound the offices, and effects of ſo different ſubſtances; but let the ſoule reſide

To this we agree, that it ſuffers with the body; for ſhe is ſad: and Ieſus ſayd, My ſoule is ſad, euen to the death; diſcouering, in himſelfe, humane paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and affection.

<pb facs="tcp:177530:197"/>It is the ſoule ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that needes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but as an inſtrument.

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is, hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been: and vnder the Sunne there is nothing new; but, All is vanitie. I doe hate all the parts of this life; ſayd Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes: But, he that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted life, muſt needs haue thought well of death; yea, hee did certainely
<pb facs="tcp:177530:199"/>think better of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the dead, than of the liuing, &amp; iudged him happie, that neuer made entrance into the world, nor had any part in vanitie. My hart, ſaid he, turned aſide to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the pleaſures, annoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and bragges of the wicked &amp; I found them more bitter than death it ſelfe: not that death in it ſelfe is bitter, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. And life is alſo more bitter than death; for, without all compariſon, it is a more grieuous
<pb facs="tcp:177530:199"/>thing to liue in ſin, than to die: for, as long as a wicked man liues, his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquitie encreaſeth; if he die, his ſinne comes to an ende. Many are glad, when they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued of their crimes; &amp; they doe well herein, if they determine to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend: but they are very ſottiſh in this, if their willes ſtill ſtand to the propagation of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and better it had been for them, to haue beene condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, for impairing the great heape of their ſins
<pb facs="tcp:177530:200"/>and miſdeedes. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeakes very wel, and grauely to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.2.</note> That not onely thoſe, which committe wickednes, but they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo which approue of it, are worthie of death: and they which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that, that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, are inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and condemned by their owne ſentence; for, in condemning of others, they iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But, take good heeds, O thou man, (ſayd the Apoſtle) how thou contemneſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of patience, and the goodneſſe of God, who

Out of al this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that death in it ſelf, is not an euill thing; for there is no death, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for thoſe in this world, or thoſe out of it. For the liuing, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:177530:201"/>they liue: and for the dead, they are out of his clouches. And ſo it is no euill, or diſcommoditie to the liuing, who haue nothing to do therwith, nor to thoſe, which in reſpect of the bodie, are inſenſible, and in their ſoules freely deliuered from the ſame.</p>

               <p>IF death be redoubted of the liuing, I ſay, it

For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, death is the gate of repoſe to the righteous; as on the contrary, it is the ſhipwracke, and ruine of the wicked. Out of queſtion it is not the paſſage of death, that offendeth them, that feare to die: but
<pb facs="tcp:177530:202"/>it is the apprehenſion, and horrible conceit of this paſſage, that thus tormenteth them. In briefe, as I ſaide before, death greeues vs not, but the apprehenſion thereof. Now, this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible apprehenſion is grounded vpon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent opinion of our infirmitie, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to trueth: for, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie encourageth; opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on daunteth vs. I will further auerre, opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe hath a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to life, and not to death: and, we ſhal find,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:203"/>that it is life it ſelf, which we iudge grieuous: wher upon it appeares, that the apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we haue of death, muſt not be referred to death it ſelfe but to life: for, if we haue done nothing in our liues, whereof to be afeard, wee haue no iuſt cauſe to feare death; for, puniſhment deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by reaſon of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces committed, feareth thoſe of true iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and to commit ſinne, is an action of the liuing and not of the dead. Life therefore hath relation
<pb facs="tcp:177530:203"/>to vs; and the vigor, and propagatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame, is ſuppoſed to be in our power: but, death (which is the ſeparation of the ſoule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body) doth preiudice vs nothing at all. The ſoule is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the bodie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes vnto duſt, from whence it came. The deliuered part reioiceth: the body which goes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, feeles nothing; and conſequently, hath no apprehenſion therof. But, if death bee an euill thing, how comes it to paſſe, that young men
<pb facs="tcp:177530:204"/>feare not to growe old, and flie not the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour age vnto death? From whence proceeds it, that one which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees his owne death, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more willingly, than another, whom death ſurpriſeth of a ſudden? So that I ſuppoſe, they are very well ſatisfied, which tooke death to be an euill thing; and it were but for this onely reaſon (amongſt many others) that by life we paſſe to death, and by death we return to life: for, none can riſe again,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:204"/>except he firſt die. It is true, that fooles feare death, as the worſt thing that can befall them: but, the wiſe deſire it, becauſe it is the eaſe of their labours, and the end of their trauels. For, that which otherwiſe may bee ſaid, there are two reaſons, why fooles feare death; one is, that they call it death, &amp; annihilation: which in deed ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the ſoule liues, when the body is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to aſhes; &amp; beſides, the bodie it ſelfe alſo,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:205"/>muſt riſe againe: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, becauſe they fear the torments &amp; puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherof Poeticall books make often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is to ſay, the barkings of <hi>Cerberus,</hi> the terrible profunditie of the riuer <hi>Cocytus,</hi> the Ferri-man <hi>Caron,</hi> the troups of Furies, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall depths, wherein the monſter <hi>Hydra</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, that deuoures all; where wee may ſee <hi>Titius,</hi> whoſe intrailes renew, &amp; growe again, after they haue been ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a great huge Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:205"/>which neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to torment him: In like manner <hi>Ixion,</hi> who rowles inceſſantly the great ſtone, with the huge rock hanging iuſt ouer their heads that make good cheare, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to fall vpon them. Theſe be the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets fables. But ſo, that wee muſt not denie, but there is puniſhment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death: And, if wee referre that to death, which happens after it, let vs alſo referre vnto life, that which fals out after life. Puniſhment
<pb facs="tcp:177530:206"/>therefore muſt haue no relation vnto death; the which as before was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, is but a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoule from the bodie. And this ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not euill, ſeeing that to be diſſolued,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> and liue with Ieſus Chriſt, is the beſt thing of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſaith the Apoſtle. It followeth then, that death of it ſelfe is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. True it is, that the death of ſinners is euill. From whence I collect, that therefore all death in generall is not bad, but that only of ſinners,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:206"/>in particular: for,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 14. &amp; 116.</note> the death of the righteous is precious: the which once more declares, that the euil lies not indeath, but in ſinne. The Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans expreſſed death, by a word, which impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to haue end, becauſe it is the end of this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life. The Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo calleth death a ſleep: witneſſe hereof, that which IESVS CHRIST ſayde,
<note place="margin">Iohn 10.</note> Our friende <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> ſleepeth, but I will goe, and wake him. Sleepe is a good thing: for then wee take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:207"/>according vnto that which was written:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 3.</note> I ſlept, tooke my reſt, &amp; awaked againe, becauſe the Lord receiued mee into his protection. The ſleep of death therfore, is a ſweete repoſe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes, and raiſeth vp them that ſleepe, for he is the reſurrection. Ther is alſo a notable ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the Scripture, which ſayth,
<note place="margin">Eccle. 2.</note> Praiſe no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death; for, euery one is knowen at the end of his life, and he is iudged in his children, if
<pb facs="tcp:177530:207"/>he haue taught, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them, in his owne knowledge: for, the childrens miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, is euer aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the fathers negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. And becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery liuing man is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to offend, old age it ſelfe, not being exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here-from: we read, that <hi>Abraham</hi> died in a good old age, becauſe hee continued ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which he had to ſerue God. Death, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſerues for a reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to a precedent
<pb facs="tcp:177530:208"/>life. For, if the Pilot be not worthy of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, before he hath brought his ſhip ſecure into the Porte; what reputation can we holde a man in before the houre of his death? Hee is his owne Pilot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſtormes, and waues of this life: as long as here hee ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iournes, he is in danger to periſh. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine receiueth not his triumphaunt Crowne, before the victorie be wonne; the Souldier layeth not aſide his
<pb facs="tcp:177530:208"/>Armes, nor hath his due recompenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ouerthrowe of the enemie. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is, that death is the full and entire pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the faithfull mans wages; it is the ſumme of his rewarde, and his finall <hi>Quietus eſt.</hi> Let vs alſo conſider what <hi>Iob</hi> ſayth,
<note place="margin">Iob 29.</note> That the bleſſing of the dead came vpon him: for, though ISAAC bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his children dying, and IACOB alſo bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Patriarkes, theſe benedictions can not
<pb facs="tcp:177530:209"/>bee referred to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter, but to that, which the benedicents conſidered in thoſe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they bleſſed, or to their fatherly affection. But here we neither ſee the one, nor the other, more then the priuiledge one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of death; the benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of him who dies, being of ſuch efficacie, as the holy Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker thereof. Let vs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, and conſider well on this verſe, to the end, that when wee ſee the poore man die, we may
<pb facs="tcp:177530:209"/>aſſiſt him, and euerie one of vs ſay, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the dead come vpon me. If we ſee any body ſicke, let vs not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon him; if hee bee forſaken of others, let not vs drawe backe, but let vs remember to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that the benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead may come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. How many men hath this ſhort verſe procured to be bleſſed? How often hath it made me bluſn, when I forgot the dying, when I viſited not the ſicke, when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the poore, when I
<pb facs="tcp:177530:210"/>haue ſuffered the poore captiue to be oppreſſed in priſon, or when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and neglected the auncient man? Let this therefore bee deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprinted in our hearts, for the ſpurring forwarde of the more dull, and for the further encouragement of all thoſe, which are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a good courſe. Let the laſt wordes of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man reſounde in thine eares: and let his ſoule, iſſuing out of his body, carrie with it from thee, this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
<pb facs="tcp:177530:210"/>Deliuer him, that is ledde to die, and who had periſhed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy ſuccour; to the end thou mayeſt then iuſtly ſay to thy ſelfe, The bleſſing of the dead light vpon mee.</p>

Cauſe vs to ſee that felicitie, which is alwayes like to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, indiſſoluble, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, in whom wee are eternall, in whome we knowe all good; in whome there is entire and perfect reſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall life, perpetuall grace, holy inheritance for the ſoule, and a ſecure tranquillitie, not beeing ſubiect vnto death, but abſolued and freed from the ſame, without tears or lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. For wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:177530:227"/>ſhould any one there la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing no body there offendeth either God, his neighbour, or himſelfe? Briefly, it is in this land of the liuing, where the Saints are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from all errour, from care, from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, from follie, from pride, from feares, from perturbations, couetous deſires, paſſions; and laſtly, from all other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamination. Seeing the land of the liuing is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we muſt account this world, the Region of the dead: the which
<pb facs="tcp:177530:227"/>is moſt true, ſeeing there are the ſhadow, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; the gates of death. Notwithſtanding, if the righteous man gouerne himſelfe according to the will of God, to doe the ſame, he ſhall liue, &amp; then come to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the liuing, where life is not confined, but free; where, in ſtead of ſhadowe, ther is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> being in this worlde, was not yet in glory: hee mourned in this body of death, and ſayd, that our life was layed vp with Chriſt, in
<pb facs="tcp:177530:228"/>God,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> but when Chriſt our life ſhould appeare, we ſhould alſo appeare with him in glory. Let vs therefore chearefully aduance forwarde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the way. Hee that enters into the true way,
<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.</note> ſhall liue. Wee haue teſtimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.</note> in the woman, which touched but the hem of Chriſt his garment, and ſhe was deliuered from death, as hee ſayd vnto her, Thy faith hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee, goe away in peace. For, if hee that touched a dead man,
<pb facs="tcp:177530:228"/>was defiled, he that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the liuing, ſhall certainely bee quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Let vs therefore ſeeke after the Lord of life. But ſo we muſt be carefull, not to ſearch after him, amongſt the dead, leſt it be ſaid vnto vs, as it was vnto the women: Why ſeeke you him liuing, amongſt the dead? hee is not here, but riſen vp: The Lorde himſelfe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, where it is, that hee woulde haue vs ſeeke for him, ſaying: Go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my brethren, and tell
<pb facs="tcp:177530:229"/>them, I aſcend vp to my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.
<note place="margin">Iohn 20.</note> Let vs inquire for him, where <hi>Iohn</hi> his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple enquired for him, and founde him out; that is to ſay, liuing with his Father, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and being his eternall Sonne. Wee muſt ſeeke him out, in theſe laſt times, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his feete, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnipping him; that ſo, he may vouchſafe to ſay vnto vs, Fear not: which importes thus much: Feare not the ſinnes of
